      <h3>
        By Henry B. Fuller
      </h3>
      <p>
        Bert Leston Taylor (known the country over as &ldquo;B.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;T.&rdquo;)
        was the first of our day&#8217;s &ldquo;colyumists&rdquo;&mdash;first in
        point of time, and first in point of merit. For nearly twenty years,
        with some interruptions, he conducted &ldquo;A Line-o&#8217;-Type or Two&rdquo;
        on the editorial page of the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>. His broad
        column&mdash;broad by measurement, broad in scope, and a bit broad, now
        and again, in its tone&mdash;cheered hundreds of thousands at the
        breakfast-tables of the Middle West, and on its trains and trolleys. As
        the &ldquo;Column&rdquo; grew in reputation, &ldquo;making the Line&rdquo;
        became almost a national sport. Whoever had a happy thought, whoever
        could handily turn a humorous paragraph or tune a pointed jingle, was
        only too glad to attempt collaboration with B.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;T. Others,
        possessing no literary knack, chanced it with brief reports on the
        follies or ineptitudes of the &ldquo;so-called human race.&rdquo; Some
        of them picked up their matter on their travels&mdash;these were the
        &ldquo;Gadders.&rdquo; Others culled oddities from the provincial press,
        and so gave further scope <a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">viii</span><span class="ns">]
        /></span></a>to &ldquo;The Enraptured Reporter,&rdquo; or offered
        selected gems of <i>gaucherie</i> from private correspondence, and thus
        added to the rich yield of &ldquo;The Second Post.&rdquo; Still humbler
        helpers chipped in with queer bits of nomenclature, thereby aiding the
        formation of an &ldquo;Academy of Immortals&rdquo;&mdash;an organization
        fully officered by people with droll names and always tending, as will
        become apparent in the following pages, to enlarge and vary its roster.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these contributors, as well as many other persons who existed
        independently of the &ldquo;Line,&rdquo; lived in the corrective fear of
        the &ldquo;Cannery,&rdquo; that capacious receptacle which yawned for
        the trite word and the stereotyped phrase. Our language, to B.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;T.,
        was an honest, living growth: deadwood, whether in thought or in the
        expression of thought, never got by, but was marked for the burning. The
        &ldquo;Cannery,&rdquo; with its numbered shelves and jars, was a
        deterrent indeed, and anyone who ventured to relieve himself as &ldquo;Vox
        Populi&rdquo; or as a conventional versifier, did well to walk with
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over all these aids, would-be or actual, presided the Conductor himself,
        furnishing a steady framework by his own quips, jingles and
        philosophizings, and bringing each day&#8217;s exhibit to an ordered
        unity. The Column was more than the sum of its contributors. It was the
        sum of <a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">ix</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>units,
        original or contributed, that had been manipulated and brought to high
        effectiveness by a skilled hand and a nature wide in its sympathies and
        in its range of interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taylor had the gift of opening new roads and of inviting a willing
        public to follow. Or, to put it another way, he had the faculty of
        making new moulds, into which his helpers were only too glad to pour
        their material. Some of these &ldquo;leads&rdquo; lasted for weeks; some
        for months; others persisted through the years. The lifted wand evoked,
        marshalled, vivified, and the daily miracle came to its regular
        accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taylor hewed his Line in precise accord with his own taste and fancy.
        All was on the basis of personal preference. His chiefs learned early
        that so rare an organism was best left alone to function in harmony with
        its own nature. The Column had not only its own philosophy and its own
        æsthetics, but its own politics: if it seemed to contravene other and
        more representative departments of the paper, never mind. Its conductor
        had such confidence in the validity of his personal predilections and in
        their identity with those of &ldquo;the general,&rdquo; that he carried
        on things with the one rule of pleasing himself, certain that he should
        find no better rule for pleasing others. His success was complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        His papers and clippings, found in a fairly <a name="png.010"
        id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">x</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>forward state of
        preparation, gave in part the necessary indications for the completion
        of this volume. The results will perhaps lack somewhat the typographical
        effectiveness which is within the reach of a metropolitan daily when
        utilized by a &ldquo;colyumist&rdquo; who was also a practical printer,
        and they can only approximate that piquant employment of juxtaposition
        and contrast which made every issue of &ldquo;A Line-o&#8217;-Type or
        Two&rdquo; a work of art in its way. But no arrangement of items from
        that source could becloud the essential nature of its Conductor: though
        &ldquo;The So-Called Human Race&rdquo; sometimes plays rather tartly and
        impatiently with men&#8217;s follies and shortcomings, it clearly and
        constantly exhibits a sunny, alert and airy spirit to whom all things
        human made their sharp appeal.

        Masefield that great literary work requires leisure. Lack of leisure is
        handicapping us in the writing of a romance. We compose it while waiting
        for trains, while shoveling snow and coal, while riding on the L, while
        shaving; and we write it on the backs of envelopes, on the covering of
        packages, on the margins <a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span

        wrote Don Quixote; but we can&#8217;t find time to commit a greater
        misdemeanor than this column, and there is no jail sentence for that.
        The only compensation for the literary method we are forced to adopt is
        that there is a great deal of &ldquo;go&rdquo; in it.

        time there dwelt in a small but very expensive cottage on the outskirts
        of a pine forest a gentleman with his wife and two children. It was a
        beautiful estate and the neighborhood was the very best. Nobody for
        miles around was worth less than five million dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night the gentleman tapped at his wife&#8217;s boudoir, and
        receiving permission to enter, he said: &ldquo;Pauline, I have been
        thinking about our children. I overheard the governess say to-day that
        they are really bright and interesting, and as yet unspoiled. Perhaps if
        they had a fair chance they might amount to something.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reginald,&rdquo; replied his wife, &ldquo;you are growing morbid
        about those children. You will be asking to see them next.&rdquo; She
        shrugged her gleaming shoulders, and rang for the maid to let down her
        hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember our own youth and shudder, Pauline,&rdquo; said the
        gentleman. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a shame to allow <a name="png.038"

        Melisande to grow up in this atmosphere.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady petulantly, &ldquo;what do you
        suggest?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it would be wise and humane to abandon them. The butler
        or the chauffeur can take them into the wood and lose them and some
        peasant may find and adopt them, and they may grow up to be worthy
        citizens. At least it is worth trying.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do as you please,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;The children are a
        collaboration; they are as much yours as mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This conversation was overheard by little Melisande, who had stolen down
        from her little boudoir in her gold-flowered nightdress for a peep at
        her mamma, whom she had not seen for a long, long time. The poor child
        was dreadfully frightened, and crept upstairs weeping to her brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Percival, who was a brave little chap. &ldquo;We
        shall find our way out of the wood, never fear. Give me your pearl
        necklace, Melisande.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The wondering child dried her eyes and fetched the necklace, and
        Percival stripped off the pearls and put them in the pocket of his
        velvet jacket. &ldquo;They can&#8217;t lose us, sis,&rdquo; said he.

      </h4>
      <p>
        In the morning the butler took the children a long, long way into the
        woods, pretending that he had discovered a diamond mine; and, bidding
        them stand in a certain place till he called, he went away and did not
        return. Melisande began to weep, as usual, but Percival only laughed,
        for he had dropped a pearl every little way as they entered the wood,
        and the children found their way home without the least difficulty.
        Their father was vexed by their cleverness, but their mamma smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It&#8217;s fate, Reginald,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;They were
        born for the smart set, and they may as well fulfill their destinies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us try once more,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;Give them
        another chance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        When the servant called the children the next morning Percival ran to
        get another pearl necklace, but the jewel cellar was locked, and the
        best he could do was to conceal a four-pound bunch of hothouse grapes
        under his jacket. This time they were taken twice as far into the wood
        in search of the diamond mine; and alas! when the butler deserted them
        Percival found that the birds had eaten every grape he had dropped along
        the way. They were now really lost, and wandered all day without coming
        out anywhere, and at night <a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>they
        slept on a pile of leaves, which Percival said was much more like
        camping out than their summer in the Adirondacks. All next day they
        wandered, without seeing sign of a road or a château, and Melisande wept
        bitterly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am so hungry,&rdquo; exclaimed the poor child. &ldquo;If we
        only could get a few <i>marrons glacés</i> for breakfast!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I could eat a few macaroons myself,&rdquo; said Percival.
      </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
        On the afternoon of the third day Percival and Melisande came to a
        strange little cottage fashioned of gingerbread, but as the children had
        never tasted anything so common as gingerbread they did not recognize
        it. However, the cottage felt soft and looked pretty enough to eat, so
        Percival bit off a piece of the roof and declared it was fine. Melisande
        helped herself to the doorknob, and the children might have eaten half
        the cottage had not a witch who lived in it come out and frightened them
        away. The children ran as fast as their legs could work, for the witch
        looked exactly like their governess, who tried to make them learn to
        spell and do other disagreeable tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently they came out on a road and saw a big red automobile belonging
        to nobody in <a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>particular.
        It was the most beautiful car imaginable. The hubs were set with pigeon
        blood rubies and the spokes with brilliants; the tires were set with
        garnets to prevent skidding, and the hood was inlaid with diamonds and
        emeralds. Even Percival and Melisande were impressed. One door stood
        invitingly open and the children sprang into the machine. They were
        accustomed to helping themselves to everything that took their fancy;
        they had inherited the instinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Percival turned on the gas. &ldquo;Hang on to your hair, sis!&rdquo; he
        cried, and he burnt up the road all the way home, capsizing the outfit
        in front of the mansion and wrecking the automobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their mamma came slowly down the veranda steps with a strange gentleman
        by her side. &ldquo;These are the children, Edward,&rdquo; she said,
        picking them up, uninjured by the spill. &ldquo;Children, this is your
        new papa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The gentleman shook hands with them very pleasantly and said he hoped
        that he should be their papa long enough to get really acquainted with
        them. At which remark the lady smiled and tapped him with her fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they lived happily, after their fashion, ever afterward.

        RED RIDING-HOOD.
      </h3>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        I
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a little girl who was the prettiest creature
        imaginable. Her mother was excessively fond of her, and saw her as
        frequently as possible, sometimes as often as once a month. Her
        grandmother, who doted on her even more, had made for her in Paris a
        little red riding hood of velvet embroidered with pearl passementerie,
        which became the child so well that everybody in her set called her
        Little Red Riding-Hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day her mother said to her: &ldquo;Go, my dear, and see how your
        grandmother does, for I hear she has been ill with indigestion. Carry
        her this filet and this little pot of foie gras.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The grandmother lived in a secluded and exclusive part of the village,
        in a marble cottage situated in the midst of a wooded park. Little Red
        Riding-Hood got out of the motor when she came to the park, telling the
        chauffeur she would walk the rest of the way. She hardly passed the
        hedge when she met a Wolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whither are you going?&rdquo; he asked, looking wistfully at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a filet and a
        little pot of foie gras from my mamma.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
        said the Wolf, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll go see her, too. I&#8217;ll go this way
        and you go that, and we shall see who will be there first.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wolf ran off as fast as he could, and was first at the door of the
        marble cottage. The butler informed him that Madame was not at home, but
        he sprang through the door, knocking the servant over, and ran upstairs
        to Madame&#8217;s boudoir.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&#8217;s there?&rdquo; asked the grandmother, when the Wolf
        tapped at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,&rdquo; replied the Wolf,
        counterfeiting the child&#8217;s voice, &ldquo;who has brought you a
        filet and a little pot of foie gras.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        II
      </h4>
      <p>
        The good grandmother, who had eaten nothing for two days except a
        mallard, with a pint of champagne, cried out hungrily, &ldquo;Come in,
        my dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wolf ran in, and, falling upon the old lady, ate her up in a hurry,
        for he had not tasted food for a whole week. He then got into the bed,
        and presently Little Red Riding-Hood tapped at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wolf pitched his voice as high and unpleasant as he could, and
        called out, &ldquo;What is it, Hawkins?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;It
        isn&#8217;t Hawkins,&rdquo; replied Little Red Riding-Hood. &ldquo;It is
        your grandchild, who has brought you a filet and a little pot of foie
        gras.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in, my dear,&rdquo; responded the Wolf. And when the child
        entered he said: &ldquo;Put the filet and the little pot of foie gras on
        the gold tabouret, and come and lie down with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Little Red Riding-Hood did not think it good form to go to bed so very,
        very late in the morning, but as she expected to inherit her grandmother&#8217;s
        millions she obediently took off her gold-flowered frock, and her pretty
        silk petticoat, and her dear little diamond stomacher, and got into bed,
        where, amazed at the change for the better in her grandmother&#8217;s
        appearance, she said to her:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandmother, how thin your arms have got!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been dieting, my dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandmother, how thin your legs have got!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor makes me walk every day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandmother, how quiet you are!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This isn&#8217;t a symphony concert hall, my dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandmother, what has become of your diamond-filled teeth?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These will do, my dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And saying these words the wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood
        and ate her all up.

        AND THE BEANSTALK.
      </h3>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        I
      </h4>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a very wealthy widow who lived in a marble
        cottage approached by a driveway of the same stone, bordered with
        rhododendrons. She had an only son, Jack&mdash;a giddy, thoughtless boy,
        but very kindhearted, as many a hard-working chorus girl had reason to
        remember. Jack was an idle fellow, whose single accomplishment was
        driving an automobile, in which he displayed remarkable skill and
        recklessness; there was hardly a day he did not run over something or
        somebody. One day he bumped a very heavy workingman, whose remains
        messed up the car so badly that Jack&#8217;s mother lost patience with
        him. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&#8217;t you put
        your skill and energy to some use? If only you would slay the giant
        Ennui, who ravages our country, you would be as great a hero in our set
        as St. George of England was in his.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack laughed. &ldquo;Let him but get in the way of my car,&rdquo; said
        he, &ldquo;and I&#8217;ll knock him into the middle of next month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The boy set out gaily for the garage, to have the motor repaired, and on
        the way he met a green-goods grocer who displayed a handful of beautiful
        red, white, and blue beans. Jack stopped to look at what he supposed was
        a new kind <a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>of
        poker chip, and the man persuaded the silly youth to exchange the
        automobile for the beans.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he brought home the &ldquo;chips&rdquo; his mother laughed loudly.
        &ldquo;You are just like your father; he didn&#8217;t know beans,
        either,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dig a hole in the tennis court, Jack,
        and plant your poker chips, and see what will happen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack did as he was told to do, and the next morning he went out to see
        whether anything had happened. What was his amazement to find that a
        mass of twisted stalks had grown out of his jackpot and climbed till
        they covered the high cliff back of the tennis court, disappearing above
        it.
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        II
      </h4>
      <p>
        Jack came of a family of climbers. His mother had climbed into society
        and was still climbing. The funny thing about climbers is that they
        never deceive anybody; every one knows just what they are up to. As Jack
        had inherited the climbing passion he began without hesitation to ascend
        the beanstalk, and when he reached the top he was as tired as if he had
        spent the day laying bricks or selling goods behind a counter; but he
        perked up when he beheld a fairy in pink tights who looked very much
        like a coryphée in the first row of &ldquo;The Girly Girl.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is this a roof garden?&rdquo; asked Jack, looking about him
        curiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;No,
        kid,&rdquo; replied the Fairy, tapping him playfully with her spear.
        &ldquo;You are in the Land of Pleasure, and in yonder castle lives a
        horrid Giant called Ennui, who bores everybody he catches to death.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack put on a brave face and lighted a cigarette. &ldquo;Has he ever
        caught you, little one?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;but I&#8217;m knocking wood.
        Fairies don&#8217;t get bored until they grow old, or at least
        middle-aged.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It&#8217;s a wonder,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that the Giant
        doesn&#8217;t bore himself to death some day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He might,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;if it were not for his
        wonderful talking harp, which keeps harping upon Socialism, and the
        single tax, and the rights of labor, and a lot of other mush; but you
        see it keeps Ennui stirred up, so that he is never bored entirely stiff.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;me for that harp, if I die for it!&rdquo;
        And thanking Polly Twinkletoes for her information, and promising to buy
        her a supper when he got his next allowance, he sauntered toward the
        castle. As he paused before the great gate it was opened suddenly by a
        most unpleasant looking giantess.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; she cried, seizing Jack by the arm, &ldquo;you&#8217;re
        the young scamp who sold me that lightning cleaner last week. I&#8217;ll
        just keep you till <a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>you
        take the spots out of my husband&#8217;s Sunday pants. If you don&#8217;t,
        he&#8217;ll knock the spots out of <em>you</em>!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        III
      </h4>
      <p>
        While the Giantess spoke she dragged Jack into the castle. &ldquo;Into
        this wardrobe,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and mind you don&#8217;t make the
        smallest noise, or my man will wring your neck. He takes a nap after
        dinner, and then you&#8217;ll have a chance to demonstrate that
        grease-eradicator you sold me last week.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The wardrobe was as big as Jack&#8217;s yacht, and the key-hole as big
        as a barrel, so the boy could see everything that took place without.
        Presently the castle was shaken as if by an earthquake, and a great
        voice roared: &ldquo;Wife! wife! I smell gasoline!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack trembled, remembering that in tinkering around his car that morning
        he had spilled gas on his clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; replied the Giantess. &ldquo;It&#8217;s only the
        lightning-cleaner which that scamp of a peddler sold me the other day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Giant ate a couple of sheep; then, pushing his plate away, he called
        for his talking harp. And while he smoked, the harp rattled off a long
        string of stuff about the equal liability of all men to labor, the
        abolition of the right of inheritance, and kindred things. Jack resolved
        that when he <a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>got
        hold of the harp he would serve it at a formal dinner, under a great
        silver cover. What a sensation it would cause among his guests when it
        began to sing its little song about the abolition of the right of
        inheritance!
      </p>
      <p>
        In a short time the Giant fell asleep, for the harp, like many
        reformers, became wearisome through exaggeration of statement. Jack
        slipped from the wardrobe, seized the harp, and ran out of the castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Master! Master!&rdquo; cried the music-maker. &ldquo;Wake up! We
        are betrayed!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Glancing back, Jack saw the Giant striding after him, and gave himself
        up for lost; but at that moment he heard his name called, and he saw the
        Fairy, Polly Twinkletoes, beckoning to him from a taxicab. Jack sprang
        into the machine and they reached the beanstalk a hundred yards ahead of
        the giant. Down the stalk they slipped and dropped, the Giant lumbering
        after. Once at the bottom, Jack ran to the garage and got out his
        man-killer, and when the Giant reached ground he was knocked, as Jack
        had promised, into the middle of the proximate month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hero married the Fairy, much against his mother&#8217;s wishes; she
        knew her son all too well, and she felt certain that she should soon
        come to know Polly as well, and as unfavorably. Things turned out no
        better than she had expected. <a name="png.050" id="png.050"
        href="#png.050"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">38</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>After a month of incompatibility, and worse,
        Polly consented to a divorce in consideration of one hundred thousand
        dollars, and they all lived happily ever afterward.

        the city. It is ethereal, far away, and it leaves off in mid-air. There

        Replete with fine etherially beautiful melody and graceful
        embellishments, it represents Mozart at his best, expressing in a form
        as clear and finely finished as a delicate ivory carving that mood of
        restful, sunny, impersonal optimism which is the essence of most of his
        musical creations. It is like some finely wrought Greek idyl, the
        apotheosis of the pastoral, perfect in detail, without apparent effort,
        gently, tenderly emotional, without a trace of passionate intensity or
        restless agitation, innocent and depending, as a mere babe. It is the
        mood of a bright, cloudless day on the upland pastures, where happy
        shepherds watch their peaceful flocks, untroubled by the storm and
        stress of our modern life, a mood so foreign to the hearts and
        environment of most present day human beings, that it is rarely
        understood by player or hearer, and still more rarely enjoyed. It seems
        flat and insipid as tepid water to the fevered lips of the young
        passion-driven, ambition-goaded soul in its first stormy period of
        struggle and achievement; but later, it is welcomed as the answer to

        prominent, square, firm, and smooth; even the rich, velvety lather
        cannot disguise it. The business man collects safety razors; he collects
        collars, too. He seems to be in the habit of calling in his friends to
        see how perfectly his shirt fits at the neck. Once dressed, he goes to
        his office and is to be found at an enormous desk bristling with patent

        The experiment has been made on a small scale, and it has always failed;
        on a large scale it would only fail more magnificently. People who are
        naturally kind of heart, and of less than average selfishness, wish that
        the impossible might be compassed, but, unless they are half-witted, or
        are paid agitators, they recognize that the impossible is well named.
        Self-interest is the core of human nature, and before that core could be
        appreciably modified, if ever, the supply of heat from the sun would be
        so reduced that the noblest enthusiasm would be chilled. The utmost
        achievable in this sad world is an enlightened self-interest. This we
        expect of the United States when the peace makers gather. Anything more

      </h3>
      <p>
        Stibbs the Grocer zigzagged like a dragon-fly about his crowded store.
        Within the hour the supplies for our woodland cruise were packed in
        boxes and tagged, and ready for transportation. It was a brisk
        transaction; for Stibbs it was only one incident in a busy day. Outside
        the trolley clanged, and a Saturday crowd footed the main street of the
        Canadian city by the falls of the Saint Mary. It was hard to realize
        that solitude and a primal hush were only a few hours away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I contrasted the activity in the store of Stibbs with the drowse that
        hung over another shop in the North Country where, in earlier years, I
        used to buy my supplies. Doctor Mayhew kept the shop, which flourished
        until a pushing Scandinavian set up a more pretentious establishment;
        after which the Doctor&#8217;s shop faded away like the grin of Puss of
        Cheshire. One could not buy groceries of the Doctor in a hurry; one had
        no wish to. I always allowed the forenoon, as there was much foreign
        gossip to exchange between items, and the world&#8217;s doings to be
        discussed. The Doctor was interested in the remotest subjects. The
        pestilences of the Orient and the possibility of their spreading to our
        shores, and eventually to the North Country, gave him much <a
        name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>concern; the
        court life at St. James&#8217;s and the politics of Persia absorbed him;&mdash;local
        matters interested him not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ten pounds of flour?&rdquo; &hellip; The Doctor would pause,
        scoop in hand; then, abruptly reminded of a bit of unfinished business
        at the warehouse, he would leave the flour trembling in the balance and
        shuffle off, while I perched on the counter and swung my heels, and
        discussed packs with Ted Wakeland, another pioneer, who, spitting
        vigorously, averred that packing grub through the brush was all right
        for an Indian, but no fit task for a white man. Through the open door I
        could see the gentle swells of the Big Water washing along the crescent
        of the beach and heaping the sand in curious little crescent ridges. The
        sun beat hotly on the board walk. There were faint sounds in the
        distance, from the Indian village up the shore and the fishing community
        across the bay. Life in this parish of the Northland drifted by like the
        fleece of summer&#8217;s sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And three pounds of rice?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Doctor was back at the scales, and the weighing proceeded in
        leisurely and dignified fashion. Haste, truly, were unseemly. But at
        last the supplies were stowed in the brown pack, there were handshakings
        all round, and a word <a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>of
        advice from old heads, and I marched away with a singing heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outfitting in the Doctor&#8217;s shop was an event, a ceremonial, a
        thing to be housed in memory along with camps and trails.

        II.&mdash;THE RIVER.
      </h3>
      <p>
        He who has known many rivers knows that every watercourse has an
        individuality, which is no more to be analyzed than the personality of
        one&#8217;s dearest friend. Two rivers may flow almost side by side for
        a hundred miles, separated only by a range of hills, and resemble each
        other no more than two women. You may admire the one, and grant it
        beauty and charm; but you will love the other, and dream of it, and
        desire infinite acquaintance of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        These differences are too subtle for definition. Superficially, two
        rivers in the North Country are unlike only in this respect, that one
        has cut a deep valley through the hills and flows swiftly and shallowly
        to its sea, and the other has kept to the plateaus and drops leisurely
        by a series of cascades and short rapids, separated by long reaches of
        deep water. Otherwise their physical aspects coincide. The banks of
        archaic rock are covered with a thin soil which maintains so dense a
        tangle that the axe must clear a space for the smallest camp; their
        overhanging borders are of cedar and <a name="png.082" id="png.082"
        href="#png.082"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">70</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>alder and puckerbush and osier; their waters
        are slightly colored by the juices of the swampland; following lines of
        minimum resistance, they twist gently or sharply every little way, and
        always to the voyager&#8217;s delight, for the eye is unprepared for a
        beautiful vista, as the ear for a sudden and exquisite modulation in
        music.
      </p>
      <p class="zerobot">
        So winds the Delectable <span class="nw">River&mdash;</span>
      </p>
      <p class="ctr zerobot">
        &ldquo;<i>through hollow lands and hilly lands</i>&rdquo;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="noindent">
        idly where the vale spreads out, quickly where the hills close in; black
        and mysterious in the deep places, frank and golden in the shoal. In one
        romantic open, where the stream flows thinly over a long stretch of
        sand, the bed is of an almost luminous amber, as if its particles had
        imprisoned a little of the sunlight that had fallen on them through the
        unnumbered years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The River was somewhat low when I dipped paddle in it, and the ooze at
        the marge was a continuous chronicle of woodland life. Moose and deer,
        bear and beaver, mink and fisher, all the creatures of the wild had
        contributed to the narrative. Even the water had its tale: a line of
        bubbles would show that a large animal, likely a moose, had crossed a
        few minutes before our canoes rounded the bend. There were glimpses of
        less wary game: ducks and herons set sail at the last moment, and
        partridges, perching close at hand, cocked their foolish heads as we
        went by; <a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>two
        otters sported on a bit of beach; trout leaped every rod of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        And never a sign of man or mark of man&#8217;s destructiveness; nor axe
        nor fire had harmed a single tree. A journey of unmarred delight through
        a valley of unending green.
      </p>
      <h3 class="gilded">
        III.&mdash;SMUDGE.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This,&rdquo; you say, as you step from the canoe and help to
        fling the cargo ashore, &ldquo;this looks like good camping ground.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The place is more open than is usual, comparatively level, and a dozen
        feet above the river, which, brawling over a ledge, spreads into an
        attractive pool. The place also faces the west, where there is promise
        of a fine sunset; a number of large birches are in sight, and an
        abundance of balsam. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; you remark, stooping to untie
        the tent-bag, &ldquo;there are not many flies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Instantly a mosquito sings in your ear, and as you still his song you
        recall a recent statement by the scientist Klein, that an insect&#8217;s
        wings flap four hundred times in a second. The mind does not readily
        grasp so rapid a motion, but you accept the figures on trust, as you
        accept the distances of interstellar spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very soon you discover that you were in error about the fewness of the
        flies. They are all there&mdash;mosquitoes, black-flies, deer-flies, and
        <a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>punkies,
        besides other species strictly vegetarian. So you drop the tent-bag and
        build a smudge. Experience has taught you to make a small but hot fire,
        and when this is well under way you kick open a rotted, moss-grown cedar
        and scoop up handfuls of damp mould. This, piled on and banked around
        the fire, provides a smudge that is continuous and effective. We built
        smudges morning, noon, and night. Whenever a halt was called, if only
        for five minutes, I reached mechanically for a strip of birchbark and a
        handful of twigs. At one camping place the ring of smudges suggested the
        magic fire circle in &ldquo;Die Walküre.&rdquo; Brunhilde lay in her
        tent, in a reek of smoke, while Wotan, in no humor for song, heaped
        vegetable tinder upon the defending fires. More than once the darkening
        forest and the steel-gray sky of a Canadian twilight have set me humming
        the motives of &ldquo;The Ring,&rdquo; and I shall always remember a
        pretty picture in an earlier cruise. &ldquo;Jess&rdquo; was a stable boy
        who drove our team to the point where roads ceased, and during a halt in
        the expedition this exuberant youth reclined upon a log, and with a pipe
        fashioned from a reed sought to imitate responsively the song of the
        white-throated sparrow. He looked for all the world like Siegfried in
        his forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Smudge.&rdquo; It is not a poetic word&mdash;mere mention of it
        would distress Mr. Yeats; but it is <a name="png.085" id="png.085"
        href="#png.085"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">73</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>potent as &ldquo;Sesame&rdquo; to unlock the
        treasures of memory. And before the laggard Spring comes round again
        many of us will sigh for a whiff of yellow, acrid smoke, curling from a
        smoldering fire in the heart of the enchanted wood.
      </p>
      <h3 class="gilded">
        IV.&mdash;&ldquo;BOGWAH.&rdquo;
      </h3>
      <p>
        We have been paddling for more than an hour, through dark and slowly
        moving water. Two or three hundred yards has been the limit of the view
        ahead, as the stream swerves gracefully from the slightest rise of land,
        and flows now east, now north, now east, now south again. So long a
        stretch of navigable water is not common on the Delectable River, and we
        make the most of it, moving leisurely, and prisoning the everchanging
        picture with the imperfect camera of the eyes. Presently a too-familiar
        sound is heard above the dipping of the paddles, and the Indian at the
        stern announces, &ldquo;Bogwah!&rdquo;&mdash;which word in the tongue of
        the Chippewa signifies a shallow. And as we round the next bend we see
        the swifter water, the rocks in midstream, and the gently slanting line
        of treetops.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bogwah&rdquo; spells work&mdash;dragging canoes over sandy and
        pebbly river-bottom, or unloading and carrying around the foam of
        perilous rapids. For compensation there is the pleasure of splashing
        ankle-deep and deeper in the cool current, and <a name="png.086"
        id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>casting for
        trout in the &ldquo;laughing shallow,&rdquo; which I much prefer to the
        &ldquo;dreaming pool.&rdquo; They who choose it may fish from boat or
        ledge: for me, to wade and cast is the poetry of angling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assured that the &ldquo;bogwah&rdquo; before us extends for half a mile
        or more, we decide for luncheon, and the canoes are beached on an
        island, submerged in springtime, but at low water a heap of yellow
        sands. And I wish I might reconstruct for you the picture which memory
        too faintly outlines. Mere words will not do it, and yet one is impelled
        to try. &ldquo;All literature,&rdquo; says Mr. Arnold Bennett, in one of
        his stimulating essays, &ldquo;is the expression of feeling, of passion,
        of emotion, caused by a sensation of the interestingness of life. What
        drives a historian to write history? Nothing but the overwhelming
        impression forced upon him by the survey of past times. He is forced
        into an attempt to reconstitute the picture for others.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And so you are to imagine a marshy, brushy open, circular in shape, from
        which the hills and forest recede for a considerable distance, and into
        which a lazy brook comes to merge with the Delectable River; a place to
        which the moose travel in great numbers, as hoofmarks and cropped
        vegetation bear witness; a wild place, that must be wonderful in mist
        and moonlight. Now it is drenched with sunrays from a vaporless sky, and
        <a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>the
        white-throat is singing all around us&mdash;not the usual three sets of
        three notes, but seven triplets. Elsewhere on the River, days apart, I
        heard that prolonged melody, and although I have looked in the bird
        books for record of so sustained a song, I have not found it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="gilded">
        V.&mdash;FINE FEATHERS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is a certain school of anglers that go about the business of
        fishing with much gravity. You should hear the Great Neal discourse of
        their profundities. Lacking that privilege, you may conceive a pair of
        these anglers met beside a river, seeking to discover which of the many
        insects flying about is preferred by the trout on that particular
        morning. There is disagreement, or there is lack of evidence. It is
        decided to catch a trout, eviscerate him, and obtain internal and
        indisputable evidence. For the cast any fly is used, and when the trout
        is opened it is learned that he has been feeding on a small black
        insect; whereupon our anglers tie a number of flies to resemble that
        insect, and proceed solemnly with their day&#8217;s work. Though the
        trout scorn their fine feathers, they will not fish with any fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the subtleties of this school I have no sympathy. They might be of
        profit on waters that are much fished, but they are wasted on the <a
        name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>wilderness,
        where the trout will rise to almost any lure. When I make an expedition
        I take along two or three dozen flies, for the mere pleasure of looking
        at them, and rearranging them in the fly-book; but I wet less than half
        a dozen. On the Delectable River we cast only when trout are needed for
        the frypan. You are to picture canoes drawn up on a sandbar, and a
        ribbon of black smoke curling from a strip of birch bark that marks the
        beginning of a fire. It is time to get the fish. So I set up my rod and
        walk upstream perhaps a hundred yards, casting on the current where it
        cuts under the farther bank. Almost every cast evokes a trout; this one
        takes the tail fly, a Silver Doctor, the next one strikes the Bucktail
        dropper; any other flies would serve. The largest fish is taken on my
        return, from under the stern of one of the canoes. Where trout are so
        plentiful and so unwary, there is no call for the preparatory work of
        the evisceration school of anglers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My reason for using a dropper fly is not to offer the trout two
        counterfeit insects differing in shape or color; as commonly attached to
        the leader, the dropper swims with the tail fly. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said
        the Great Neal, in the manner of Samuel Johnson, &ldquo;when the dropper
        is properly attached, as I attach it, two aspects of the lure are
        presented to the fish, the one fly moving <a name="png.089" id="png.089"
        href="#png.089"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">77</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>through the water, the other dancing an inch
        or so above. This, Sir, is how I tie it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And sitting at the Oracle&#8217;s feet, ye learn &ldquo;all ye need to
        know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h3 class="gilded">
        VI.&mdash;THALASSA!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Trails there are that one remembers from their beginnings to their ends,
        because of the variety and charm of the pictures offered along the way.
        Monotony marks the trails that fade from memory; they represent hours of
        marching through timber of a second growth, or skirting hills where dead
        sticks stand forlorn and only the fireweed blooms. Of rememberable roads
        the last stage of our journey to the Great Water is the one I have now
        in mind. It is the longest carry, two miles or less, sharply down hill,
        though less precipitate than the river, which, after many days of
        idling, now flings itself impatiently toward the shore. We linger where
        it makes its first great leap. Many have come thus far from the south,
        and, looking on the shallow pool beyond, have decided that there is no
        profit in going farther; or they have explored a bit and, encountering
        <i>bogwah</i>, have reached the same conclusion. Who would conjecture
        that past the shallows lie leagues of deep and winding waters, reserved
        by nature as a reward for the adventurer who counts a glimpse of the
        unknown worth all the labor of <a name="png.090" id="png.090"
        href="#png.090"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">78</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>the day? We who have come from the headwaters
        know that nature has as wisely screened the river&#8217;s source. Where
        the lake ends is a forbidding tangle of water shrubs and timber; the
        outlet is an archipelago of sharp rocks, and the stream, if found, is
        seen to be small and turbulent.
      </p>
      <p class="zerobot">
        The last carry keeps the Delectable River in view; foam, seen through
        the firs, marks its plunging flight. And then we draw away from it for a
        space, and cross an open thickly strewn with great stones, a sunlit
        place, where berries and a few flowers are privileged to exist. A little
        time is spent here in picking up the trail, which has spilled itself
        among the stones; then, the narrow footway regained, we drop as quickly
        as the river, and presently our feet touch sand. We break through a
        fringe of evergreens and cry out as the Greeks cried out when they saw
        the sea. The lake at <span class="nw">last!&mdash;</span>

        training is a matter of new discoveries. A taste that has to be led by
        steps from Owen Meredith to George Meredith, which could not recognize
        the worth of the latter before passing through the former, is no true
        taste. Graduation from the simple to the complex is compatible with a

        class="smc">Speaking</span> of George Meredith, we are told again (they
        dig the thing up every two or three years) that, when a reader for
        Chapman &amp; Hall, he turned down &ldquo;East Lynne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Erewhon,&rdquo;
        and other books that afterward became celebrated. What of it? Meredith
        may not have known anything about literature, but he knew what he liked.
        Moreover, he was a marked and original writer, and as that tolerant
        soul, Jules Lemaitre, has noted, the most marked and original of writers
        are those who do not understand everything, nor feel everything, nor
        love everything, but those whose knowledge, intelligence, and tastes
        have definite limitations.

        Sir: You are kind enough to refer to my lecture on &ldquo;Literary Taste
        and How to Acquire It.&rdquo; I venture to suggest that your summary&mdash;viz.:
        &ldquo;It is to read only first-class stuff,&rdquo; not only fails to
        meet the problem, but represents exactly the view that I am out to
        demolish. If, as I presume, you mean that the ambitious person who now
        reads Harold Bell Wright should sit down to the works of Shakespeare, I
        can tell you at once that the process will be a failure. My method is
        one of graduation from the worst to the best stuff. <span

        THE EIGHTH VEIL.<br /><small>(<i>By J-mes Hun-k-r.</i>)</small>
      </h4>
      <p>
        There was a wedding under way. From the bright-lit mansion came the
        evocations of a loud bassoon. Ulick Guffle, in whom the thought of
        matrimony always produced a bitter nausea, glowered upon the house and
        spat acridly upon the <a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>pave.
        &ldquo;Imbeciles! Humbugs! Romantic rot!&rdquo; he raged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three young men drew toward the scene. Ulick barred their way, but two
        of the trio slipped by him and escaped. The third was nailed by Guffle&#8217;s
        glittering eye. Ulick laid an ineluctable hand upon the stranger&#8217;s
        arm. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Matrimony and Art are
        sworn and natural foes. Ingeborg Bunck was right; there are no
        illegitimate children; all children are valid. Sounds like Lope de Vega,
        doesn&#8217;t it? But it isn&#8217;t. It is Bunck. Whitman, too, divined
        the truth. Love is a germ; sunlight kills it. It needs l&#8217;obscurité
        and a high temperature. As Baudelaire said&mdash;or was it Maurice
        Barrès?&mdash;dans la nuit tous les chats sont gris. Remy de <span
        class="nw">Gourmont&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The wedding guest beat his shirtfront; he could hear the bassoon
        doubling the cello. But Ulick continued ineluctably. &ldquo;Woman is a
        sink of iniquity. Only Gounod is more loathsome. That Ave Maria&mdash;Grand
        Dieu! But Frédéric Chopin, nuance, cadence, appoggiatura&mdash;there you
        have it. En amour, les vieux fous sont plus fous que les jeunes. Listen
        to Rochefoucauld! And Montaigne has said, C&#8217;est le jouir et non le
        posséder qui rend heureux. And Pascal has added, Les affaires sont les
        affaires. As for Stendhal, Flaubert, Nietzsche, Edgar Saltus, Balzac,
        Gautier, <a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="ns">[p

      </p>
      <p>
        Ulick seized his head with both hands, and the wedding guest seized the
        opportunity to beat it, as the saying is. &ldquo;Swine!&rdquo; Ulick
        flung after him. &ldquo;Swine, before whom I have cast a hatful of
        pearls!&rdquo; He spat even more acridly upon the pave and turned away.
        &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;Stendhal was right. Or was
        it Huysmans? No, it was neither. It was Cambronne.&rdquo;

        rhyming of words like utterly, monody, lethargy, etc.; these endings
        seem weak when they are bunched. Our assistants will apprehend that we

        closed, as Bennett puts it. How worth while those things used to seem,
        and what pleasant days those were. Men say that they will come again.
        But men said that Arthur would come again.

        &ldquo;In Cartoonland,&rdquo; said the Hatter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo; inquired Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&#8217;m searching for an original cartoon idea,&rdquo; replied
        the Hatter. &ldquo;Would you like to come along?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ever so much,&rdquo; said Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The first thing we have to do is to get across that chasm,&rdquo;
        said the Hatter, pointing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice saw a huge legend on the far wall of the chasm, and spelled it out&mdash;&ldquo;O-b-l-i-v-i-o-n.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Oblivion,&rdquo; said the Hatter. &ldquo;That&#8217;s where

        cross a little below here.&rdquo;
      </p>

        He indicated a thin plank that lay across the Chasm of Oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will it hold us?&rdquo; said Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has held the G.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P. Elephant and the Democratic

      <p>
        &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the Hatter, &ldquo;here is my hat store.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There were only two kinds in the window&mdash;square paper caps and high
        silk hats. Alice had never seen paper caps before.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They&#8217;re worn by the laboring man,&rdquo; said the Hatter;
        &ldquo;but you never see them outside of Cartoonland. The plug hats are
        for Capitalists. I also keep whiskers; siders for Capital and ordinary
        for Labor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;O, there&#8217;s a railroad train!&rdquo; said Alice, suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No use taking that train,&rdquo; said the Hatter; &ldquo;it doesn&#8217;t
        go. Did you ever see an engine like that outside Cartoonland? And even
        if it did work we shouldn&#8217;t get very far, as the rock Obstruction
        is always on the track.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&#8217;d just as soon walk,&rdquo; said Alice.

        &ldquo;Mercy! there&#8217;s a giant!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice.

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&#8217;t be alarmed,&rdquo; said the Hatter; &ldquo;he&#8217;s
        perfectly good natured.&rdquo;

      <p>
        &ldquo;What an awful-looking creature!&rdquo; said Alice.

        then, almost everything in Cartoonland is. It&#8217;s the idea that
        counts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You said you were searching for an original idea,&rdquo; Alice
        reminded him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I don&#8217;t expect to find one,&rdquo; the Hatter replied.
        &ldquo;You see, it wouldn&#8217;t be any use; nobody would understand
        it. People like the old familiar things, you know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, we might happen on one,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;Let&#8217;s

        Suddenly a door opened, and a great quantity of rubbish was swept
        briskly into the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&#8217;s the New Broom,&rdquo; said the Hatter. &ldquo;There&#8217;s
        been another election. Evidently the Democrats won, as there goes the
        Donkey, waving his ears and hee-hawing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, is that a fruit store?&rdquo; asked Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; the Republican headquarters,&rdquo; replied the Hatter.
        &ldquo;That huge cornucopia you see is a symbol of Prosperity.
        Prosperity in Cartoonland is always represented by a horn of plenty with
        a pineapple in the muzzle. You&#8217;ve heard the expression, &lsquo;The
        pineapple of prosperity.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;but I&#8217;ve heard about the

        Presently they came to a collection of factories, the tall chimneys of
        which poured out smoke in great volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Those are the Smoking Stacks of Industry,&rdquo; said the Hatter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do they manufacture here?&rdquo; asked Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cartoonatums,&rdquo; said the Hatter. &ldquo;A cartoonatum,&rdquo;
        he explained, &ldquo;is a combination of wheels, rods, cogs, hoppers,
        cranks, etc., which sometimes looks like a sausage grinder and sometimes
        like a try-your-weight machine. It couldn&#8217;t possibly go, any more
        than the locomotives in Cartoonland.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <!--  TN: closing quote missing in original -->
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t the Cartoonlanders have machines that <em>can</em>
        go?&rdquo; inquired Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied the Hatter, &ldquo;would require a little
        study and observation.&rdquo;

        As Alice and the Hatter walked along they passed many curious things,
        such as Wolves in Sheep&#8217;s Clothing, the skin of a Tiger nailed to
        a barn door, St. George and the Dragon, Father Knickerbocker, barrels of
        political mud, a huge <a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
        /></span></a>serpent labeled &ldquo;Anarchy,&rdquo; a drug store window
        full of bottles of Political Dope and boxes of Political Pills, an
        orchard of Political Plum Trees, and other objects which the Hatter said
        were as old as the hills. &ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s nothing
        to hold us here,&rdquo; he declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice&#8217;s attention was suddenly attracted by a little girl in a
        thin and ragged dress who, with an empty basket on her arm, was gazing
        wistfully at the goodies in a bakeshop window.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She represents Poverty,&rdquo; said the Hatter. &ldquo;When she
        isn&#8217;t staring at a bakeshop she&#8217;s looking at a proclamation
        by the ice trust, or something like that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice spoke to the child and learned that she was one of a large family.
        Her father, she said, was a New York cartoonist who one day had been
        visited by an Original Idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; cried the Hatter excitedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He dropped dead!&rdquo; replied the child, weeping bitterly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; said the Hatter, and walked away.

      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The hypermoron may laugh in imitation of others, but he has no

        original wit and humor require unusual combinations of factors; but the
        very nature of the hypermoron is that he does not arrange and perceive
        such combinations. When the hypermoron does cause laughter from some
        speech or action, usually he resents it. But when a normal man
        unconsciously does or says something laughable, he himself shares in
        making sport of himself. Though at times amiable, the hypermoron

        <span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="firstword">atters</span> had
        gone ill all the day; and, to cap what is learnedly called the
        perverseness of inanimate things, it came on to rain just as the Boy,
        having finished his lessons, was on the point of setting out for a romp
        in the brown fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it perfectly mean, Mowgli?&rdquo; he complained to
        his dog. The water spaniel wagged a noncommittal tail and stretched
        himself before the wood fire with a deep drawn sigh. The rain promised
        to hold, so the Boy took down a book and curled up in a big leather
        chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a very interesting book&mdash;all about American pioneers,
        trappers, and Indians; and although the writer of it was a German
        traveler, no American woodsman would take advantage of a worthy German
        globe trotter and tell him things which were not exactly so. For
        example, if you and a trapper and a dog were gathered about a campfire,
        and the dog were asleep and dreaming in his sleep, and the trapper
        should affirm that if you tied a handkerchief over the head of a
        dreaming dog and afterwards tied it around your own head, you would have
        the dog&#8217;s dream,&mdash;if the trapper should tell you this with <a
        name="png.152" id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>a perfectly
        serious face, you naturally would believe him, especially if you were a
        German traveler.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy got up softly and began the experiment. Mowgli opened an
        inquiring eye, stretched himself another notch, and fell asleep again.
        His master waited five minutes, then unloosed the handkerchief and
        knotted it under his own chin.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while Mowgli&#8217;s slumbers were untroubled as a forest pool,
        his breathing as regular as the tick-tock of the old wooden clock under
        the stair. Out of doors the rain fell sharply and set the dead leaves
        singing. The wood fire dwindled to a glow. Tick-tock! tick-tock! drummed
        the ancient timepiece. The Boy yawned and settled deeper in the leather
        chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tick-tock! Tick-tock!
      </p>
      <p>
        Mowgli was breathing out of time. He was twitching, and making funny
        little smothered noises, which, if he were awake, would probably be
        yelps. Something exciting was going on in dreamland.
      </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
        The Boy gave chase across the fields, only to arrive, out of breath, at
        the entrance to a burrow down which the woodchuck had tumbled. <a
        name="png.153" id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>He had not a
        notion where he was. He seemed to have raced out of the world that he
        knew into one which was quite unfamiliar. It was a broad valley inclosed
        by high hills, through which a pleasant little river ran; and the
        landscape wore an odd aspect&mdash;the hills were bluer than hills
        usually are, the trees were more fantastically fashioned, and the waving
        grass and flowers were more beautiful than one commonly sees.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good morning, young sir!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side of the stream stood a tall man wrapped in a cloak and
        leaning with both hands upon a staff. He was well past the middle years,
        as wrinkles and a beard turned gray gave evidence; but his eyes were
        youthful and his cheeks as ruddy as a farm lad&#8217;s. His clothing was
        worn and dust-laden, but of good quality and unpatched, and there was an
        air about him that said plainly, &ldquo;Here is no common person, I can
        tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are wondering who I may be,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Well,
        then, I am known as the Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A queer sort of knight, this!&rdquo; thought the Boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you&mdash;may I ask whither you are bound?&rdquo; said the
        stranger. &ldquo;We may be traveling the same road.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy made answer that he had set forth <a name="png.154" id="png.154"
        href="#png.154"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">142</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>to chase a woodchuck, and that having failed
        to catch it he had no better plan than to return home.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; the Knight put on a melancholy smile, and
        cutting a reed at the river edge he fashioned it into a pipe and began
        to play. A wonderful tune it was. Tom the Piper&#8217;s Son knew the way
        of it, and to the same swinging melody the Pied Piper footed the streets
        of Hamelin town; for the burden of the tune was &ldquo;Over the Hills
        and Far Away,&rdquo; and the Boy&#8217;s feet stirred at the catch of
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;is the tune I have marched
        to for many a year, and a pretty chase it has led me.&rdquo; He put down
        the pipe. &ldquo;Knocking about aimlessly does very well for an old man,
        but youth should have a definite goal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy did not agree with this. With that magic melody marching in his
        head it was hey for the hills and the westering sun, and the pleasant
        road to Anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What lies yonder?&rdquo; he queried, pointing to a deep notch in
        the skyline.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Kingdom of Rainbow&#8217;s End,&rdquo; replied the Knight.
        &ldquo;It is an agreeable territory, and you
        <!--  TN: opening quote missing in original --> would do very well to
        journey thither. The King of the country is no longer young, and as he
        has nothing to say about affairs of state, or anything else for that

        fashion as myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And who governs while he is away?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<span class="smc">She</span>!&rdquo; said the Knight solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;<span

      </h4>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare,
        &ldquo;the King made a grave mistake some years ago. It is a foolish
        saying that when a man marries his troubles begin; but it is the law of
        Rainbow&#8217;s-End that when a man marries he may chloroform his
        mother-in-law or not, just as he pleases. But if he forfeit the right he
        may never again claim it, and the deuce take him for a soft-hearted
        simpleton.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy thought it a barbarous law and so declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is something to be said for it,&rdquo; returned the Knight.
        &ldquo;A mother-in-law is like the
        <!--  TN: original missing opening quote --> little girl with the little
        curl. It so happens that the King&#8217;s mother-in-law is a very
        unpleasant old party, and the King made a sad mess of it when he threw
        the chloroform bottle out of the window.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me about Rainbow&#8217;s-End,&rdquo; the Boy entreated.
        &ldquo;Is there a beautiful Princess, with many suitors for her hand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Princess Aralia is a very pretty girl, as <a name="png.156"
        id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>princesses go.&rdquo;
        The Knight opened a locket attached to a long gold chain and exhibited
        an exquisite miniature. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind saying,&rdquo; said
        he, &ldquo;that the Princess Aralia and I are on very good terms, and a
        word from me will procure you a cordial reception. The question is, how
        shall we set about it? You can&#8217;t present yourself at court as you
        are; you must have a horse and a fine costume, and all that sort of
        thing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps there&#8217;s a good fairy in the neighborhood,&rdquo;
        said the Boy hopefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knight shook his head. &ldquo;Not within a dozen leagues. But stop a
        bit&mdash;it is just possible that Aunt Jo can manage the matter. Aunt
        Jo is the sister of my wife&#8217;s mother, and one of the cleverest
        witches in the country. She stands very high in her profession and is
        thoroughly schooled in every branch of deviltry; and with the exception
        of my wife&#8217;s mother, I can think of no person whose society is
        less desirable. But one day in each year she takes a day off, during
        which she is as affable and benevolent an old dame as you can possibly
        imagine; really, you would never know it was the same person. These
        annual breathing spells do her a world of good, she tells me; for
        incessant wickedness is just as monotonous and wearisome as unbroken
        goodness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And to-day is the Witch&#8217;s holiday?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it so happens; and I always make it a <a name="png.157"
        id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="ns">[p </span><span

        the night at her cottage if I am in this part of the country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare rose and put his cloak about his
        shoulders, and with the Boy set forward through the valley.
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        IV.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Presently they came to the Witch&#8217;s cottage, snuggled away in a
        hollow and hidden from the road by a tangle of witch hazel shrubs. The
        Boy rather expected a dark, forbidding hut of sinister outlines, but
        here was as pretty a cabin as ever you saw, weathered a pleasing gray,
        with green blinds and a tiny porch overrun with Virginia-creeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knight strode boldly up the path, the Boy following less
        confidently. No one answering the summons at the porch, they tried the
        kitchen door. It was open, and they stepped inside. The Witch was not at
        home, but evidently she was not far away, for a fire was crackling in
        the stove and a kettle singing over the flames. An enormous black cat
        got up lazily from the hearth and rubbed himself against the visitors
        with a purr like a small dynamo.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the familiarity of a relative the Knight led the way about the
        house. One door was locked. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Aunt
        Jo&#8217;s dark room, in which she develops her deviltry. This&rdquo;&mdash;opening
        the door of a little shed&mdash;&ldquo;is the garage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.158" id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>The
        Boy peeped in and saw two autobroomsticks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The small green one is her runabout. The big red one is a touring
        broomstick, high power and very fast; you can hear her coming a mile
        off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They returned to the sitting room, and the Boy became greatly taken with
        Aunt Jo&#8217;s collection of books. Some of these were: &ldquo;One
        Hundred and One Best Broths,&rdquo; &ldquo;Witchcraft Self-Taught,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;The Black Art&mdash;Berlitz Method,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Burbank&#8217;s
        Complete Wizard.&rdquo; The Boy took down the &ldquo;Complete Wizard,&rdquo;
        but he was not able to do more than glance at the absorbing contents
        before the clicking of the gate announced that the Witch had returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aunt Jo was a sprightly dame of more than seventy years, very thin, but
        straight and supple, and with hair still jet black. Her eyes were
        gray-green or green-gray, as the light happened to strike them; her
        cheeks were hollow, and a long sharp chin slanted up to meet a long
        sharp nose. Ordinarily, as the Knight had hinted, she was no doubt an
        unholy terror, but to-day she was in the best of humors, and her eyes
        twinkled with good nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I just stepped out,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;to carry some
        jelly and cake to one of my neighbors, a woodcutter&#8217;s wife. The
        poor woman has been ill all the summer! Mercy! if I haven&#8217;t had a
        <a name="png.159" id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>day
        of it!&rdquo; She dropped into a chair, brushing a fly from the tip of
        her nose with the tip of her tongue. &ldquo;How is everything in Rainbow&#8217;s-End?&rdquo;
        she asked. &ldquo;I suppose <span class="smc">She</span> is as bad as
        ever.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; replied the Knight, fetching a sigh. &ldquo;And
        <span class="smc">She</span> never takes a day off, as you do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Henry, it&#8217;s your own fault, as I&#8217;ve told you a
        thousand times. If you hadn&#8217;t been so soft-hearted&mdash; But
        mercy! that&#8217;s no way to be talking on my holiday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the Boy to himself. &ldquo;This wandering knight
        is the King of Rainbow&#8217;s-End and the father of the Princess. I
        have a friend at court indeed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        V.
      </h4>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how is the Princess Aralia?&rdquo; asked the Witch. &ldquo;As
        pretty as ever, I suppose, and with no prospect of a husband, thanks to
        her grandmother and the silly tasks she sets for the suitors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That brings us to the business of our young friend here,&rdquo;
        said the Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare. &ldquo;He wishes to present
        himself at court, and is in great need of a horse and wardrobe.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You&#8217;ve come to the wrong shop for horses and fine feathers,&rdquo;
        said the Witch. &ldquo;Those things are quite out of my line.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy looked his disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.160" id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;The
        best I can do,&rdquo; said Aunt Jo kindly, &ldquo;is to give you a
        letter to a Mr. Burbank, an excellent wizard of my acquaintance. He has
        recently invented a skinless grape and a watermelon that is all heart,
        and is quite the cleverest man in the business. Such a trifle as
        changing a pig into a horse will give him no trouble whatever. Have you
        seen my garden, Henry?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but I should like to,&rdquo; said the Knight rising.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; said the Witch, &ldquo;I will start the supper
        if our young friend will fetch the wood.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy responded with such cheerful readiness that Aunt Jo patted him
        on the cheek and said: &ldquo;You&#8217;re the lad for the Princess
        Aralia, and have her you shall if Aunt Jo can bring it about. And now go
        out in the garden and pick me a hatful of Brussels sprouts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible to imagine a more appetizing supper than that which
        the three sat down to. Everything was prepared to a nicety, and the
        Knight could not say enough in praise of the raised biscuits and home
        made currant jell. As for the doughnuts, &ldquo;Such doughnuts can&#8217;t
        be made without witchcraft, Jo,&rdquo; he declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t put a
        thing into them that any good cook doesn&#8217;t use. Making doughnuts
        always was an art by itself. You must both take some with you when you
        go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.161" id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>After
        supper the Knight wiped the dishes while the Witch washed them, Aunt Jo
        declaring it a shame that a man so domestically inclined should be
        compelled to wander from one end of the rainbow to the other just
        because of a foolish tender-heartedness in days gone by. While the pair
        discussed this fruitful topic the Boy dipped into the fascinating
        chapters of the &ldquo;Complete Wizard.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Time for bed,&rdquo; announced the Knight an hour later; and he
        added for the Boy&#8217;s ear: &ldquo;We must make an early start in the
        morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I for one shall sleep soundly,&rdquo; Aunt Jo declared. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve
        run my legs off to-day, as I never use a broomstick on my holiday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She conducted her guests to a tiny bedchamber above stairs. &ldquo;I
        will leave a bag of doughnuts on the table, Henry,&rdquo; said she,
        &ldquo;as I suppose you will be off before I am up. Good-night!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        When she had gone below the Knight said: &ldquo;We must be moving with
        the first streak of day. Aunt Jo&#8217;s holiday ends with sun-up, and
        you would find her a vastly different old party, I can tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        VI.
      </h4>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think I should be afraid of her,&rdquo; said the
        Boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knight chuckled, and without further speech got into bed and was
        soon wrapped in a <a name="png.162" id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
        /></span></a>deep slumber. Next to a clear conscience and the open road,
        a good bed at night is something to set store by.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Boy could not sleep for the exciting pictures that danced in his
        head, and he was impatient for the morning light, that he might be on
        his way to Rainbow&#8217;s-End. The moon peeped in the window; the
        breeze made a pleasant sound in the poplar trees; from somewhere came
        the music of a little brook. To all these gentle influences the Boy
        finally yielded.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was awakened by a plucking at his sleeve.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Time to be moving,&rdquo; said the Knight in a hoarse whisper.
        &ldquo;We can put on our shoes after we leave the house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They crept down the stair, which creaked in terrifying fashion, but a
        gentle snoring from the Witch&#8217;s bedroom reassured them. After they
        had tiptoed out of the house and gained the road they discovered that
        they had forgotten the bag of doughnuts. The Knight declared that he
        would not return for a million doughnuts, but the Boy, remembering how
        delicious they tasted, stole back to the door and lifted the latch
        softly. Aunt Jo was still snoring, but, just as he laid hold of the
        doughnuts, Pluto the cat came leaping in from the kitchen, and the Boy
        had barely time to put the door between its sharp claws and himself. He
        ran down the path, vaulted the gate, and looked <a name="png.163"
        id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>about for the
        Knight. Away down the road was a rapidly diminishing figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy was a good runner, and he was fast overtaking the Knight, when
        the latter, who had been casting anxious glances over his shoulder as he
        ran, suddenly plunged into the bushes at one side of the road. The Boy
        thought it wise to follow his example.
      </p>
      <p>
        And not a moment too soon. A small whirring sound grew louder and
        louder, and Aunt Jo went whizzing by on her high power autobroomstick,
        leaving in her wake a horrible reek of gasoline and brimstone. But not
        the Aunt Jo of the evening before. Her green eyes flashed behind the
        goggles, and her face was something dreadful to behold. On her shoulder
        perched Pluto, every hair erect, and spitting fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Boy gasped, and hoped he had seen the last of the terrible hag, when
        the whirring noise announced that she was coming back. She stopped her
        broomstick directly opposite the hiding-place and began cutting small
        circles in the air, the while peering sharply about.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Boy plunged into the thicket, he fell. As he lay there, something
        cold pressed against his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Mowgli&#8217;s nose. The dog&#8217;s eyes questioned his master,
        who had cried out in his sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Mowgli!&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking the spaniel <a
        name="png.164" id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>by his shaggy
        ears, &ldquo;did you dream <em>all</em> that wonderful dream? Or did you
        stop at the woodchuck hole? What a shame, Mowgli, if there shouldn&#8217;t
        really be a Knight of the Dusty Thoroughfare, and a Princess Aralia and
        a Witch who makes wonderful doughnuts!&rdquo;

        revives two good laughs&mdash;thus: &ldquo;A fugue is a piece in which
        the voices one by one come in and the people one by one go out.&rdquo;
        Also he quotes from Sam&#8217;l Butler&#8217;s Note Books: &ldquo;I
        pleased Jones by saying that the hautbois was a clarinet with a cold in
        its head, and the bassoon the same with a cold in its chest.&rdquo; The
        cor anglais suffers slightly from both symptoms. Some ambitious
        composer, by judicious use of the more diseased instruments, could
        achieve the most rheumy musical effects, particularly if, à la Scriabin,
        he should have the atmosphere of the concert hall heavily charged with

        We, let me ask, what are we, the choicer of spirits as well as the more
        frugal if not the undeservedly impoverished, what, I ask, are we to do
        now that the hansom has disappeared, as they say, from the London
        streets and the taxicab so wonderfully yet extravagantly taken its
        place? Is there, indeed, else left for us than the homely but hallowed
        &#8217;bus, as we abbreviatedly yet all so affectionately term it&mdash;the
        &#8217;bus of one&#8217;s earlier days, when London was new to the
        unjaded sensorium and &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; was so wonderfully, so

        yet so congruously &ldquo;goes with it&rdquo;&mdash;the weather

      <p>
        Maria Wickwyre, of the Five Towns, emerged from muddy Bombazine Lane and
        stood in the rain and wind at Pie Corner, eighty-four yards from the
        door of St. Jude&#8217;s chapel, in the Strand. She was in London! Yes,
        she was on that spot, she and none other. It might have been somewhere
        else; it might have been somebody else. But it wasn&#8217;t. Wonderful!
        The miracle of Life overcame her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had arms. Two of them. They were big and round, like herself. One
        held a large parcel (&ldquo;package&rdquo; for the American edition);
        the other, an umbrella. She also had two legs. She stood on them. If
        they had been absent, or if they had weakened, she would have collapsed.
        But they <a name="png.193" id="png.193" href="#png.193"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>held
        her up. Ah, the mysteries of existence! More than ever was she conscious
        of her firm, strong underpinning. Maria waved her umbrella and her
        parcel and stopped a &#8217;bus. The driver was elderly, wrinkled,
        weatherbeaten. Maria got in and rode six furlongs and some yards to
        Mooge Road, and then she stopped the &#8217;bus to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she was conscious of her upper members and their charges, she was
        still more conscious of her lower ones. If she had her parcel and her
        umbrella to think about, she also had her stockings and petticoats to
        consider. The wind blew, the rain drizzled, the driver looked around,
        wondering why Maria didn&#8217;t get out and have done with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If he should see them!&rdquo; she gasped. (You know what she
        meant by &ldquo;them.&rdquo;) Her round, broad face mutely implored the
        &#8217;busman to look the other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wearily closed his eyes. He had been rumbling through the Strand for
        thirty years. &ldquo;Lor&#8217;, mum,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;legs ain&#8217;t
        no treat to me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Maria collapsed, after all, and took the 4:29 for home that same
        afternoon.

        LETTER IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WEDDING PRESENT.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Dear Lady Amblesham,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who gives quickly, says the old proverb, gives twice. For this reason I
        have purposely delayed writing to you, lest I should appear to thank you
        more than once for the small, cheap, hideous present you sent me on the
        occasion of my recent wedding. Were you a poor woman, that little bowl
        of ill-imitated Dresden china would convict you of tastelessness merely;
        were you a blind woman, of nothing but an odious parsimony. As you have
        normal eyesight and more than normal wealth, your gift to me proclaims
        you at once a Philistine and a miser (or rather did so proclaim you
        until, less than ten seconds after I had unpacked it from its wrappings
        of tissue paper, I <a name="png.206" id="png.206" href="#png.206"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]
        /></span></a>took it to the open window and had the satisfaction of
        seeing it shattered to atoms on the pavement). But stay! I perceive a
        flaw in my argument. Perhaps you were guided in your choice by a
        definite wish to insult me. I am sure, on reflection, that this is so.
        <em>I shall not forget.</em>

        Yours, etc.<br /><span class="sigrt smc">Cynthia Beaumarsh.</span>

        all systems of philosophy existed in order to pour into him, which is
        hardly true, and that all future systems would flow out of him, which is

      <p class="chapstart">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="firstword">nce</span> upon a
        time, not far removed from yesterday, there lived a poor book reviewer
        named Abner Skipp. He was a kindly man and an excellent husband and a
        most congenial soul to chat with, for he possessed a store of
        information on the most remote and bootless subjects drawn from his
        remarkable library&mdash;an accumulation of volumes sent to him for
        review, and which he had been unable to dispose of to the dealers in
        second-hand books. For you are to understand that too little literary
        criticism is done on a cash basis. Occasionally a famous author, like
        Mr. Howells, is paid real money to write something about Mr. James, or
        Mr. James is substantially rewarded for writing about Mr. Howells, and
        heads of departments and special workers are handsomely remunerated; but
        the journeyman reviewer is paid in books; and these are the source of
        his income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, every morning in the busy season, or perhaps once a week when
        trade was dull, Abner Skipp journeyed from the suburbs to the city with
        his pack of books on his back, and made the <a name="png.220"
        id="png.220" href="#png.220"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>rounds of the
        second-hand shops, disposing of his wares for whatever they would fetch.
        Novels, especially what are known as the &ldquo;best sellers,&rdquo;
        commanded good prices if they were handled, like fruit, without delay;
        but they were such perishable merchandise that oftentimes a best seller
        was dead before Abner could get it to market; and as he frequently
        reviewed the same novel for half a dozen employers, and therefore had
        half a dozen copies of it in his pack, the poor wretch was sadly out of
        pocket, being compelled to sell the dead ones to the junkman for a few
        pennies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abner Skipp was an industrious artisan and very skillful at his trade;
        working at top speed, he could review more than a hundred books in a day
        of eight hours. In a contest of literary critics held in Madison Square
        Garden, New York, Abner won first prize in all three events&mdash;reviewing
        by publisher&#8217;s slip, reviewing by cover, and reviewing by title
        page. But shortly after this achievement he had had the misfortune to
        sprain his right arm in reviewing a new edition of the Encyclopedia
        Britannica, which accident so curtailed his earning power that he fell
        behind in a money way, and was compelled to mortgage his home. But Abner
        Skipp was a cheerful, buoyant soul; and as his arm grew better and he
        was again able to wield the implements of his trade, he set bravely to
        work to mend his broken fortunes.
      </p>
      <h4 class="glided">
        <a name="png.221" id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="ns">[p

      </h4>
      <p>
        If Abner Skipp had had nothing but popular novels to review he would
        assuredly have perished of starvation, but frequently he received a
        medical work, or a history, or a volume of sportive philosophy by
        William James, or some such valuable work, which he could sell for a
        round sum. There was always plenty to do&mdash;all the best magazines
        employed him, and twice in the year&mdash;a month in spring and a month
        in fall&mdash;books came to him in such numbers that the expressman
        dumped them into the house through a shute like so many coals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mrs. Skipp assisted her husband all she could, but being a frail little
        woman she was able to work on only the lightest fiction. Angelica, the
        oldest daughter, cleared the book bin of a good deal of poetry and gift
        books, and even Grandpa Skipp was intrusted with a few juveniles.
      </p>
      <p>
        But none of the family was more helpful than little Harold, who, after
        school time, worked side by side with his father, trimming the ready
        made review slips which publishers send out with books, and seeing that
        the paste pot never got empty or the paste too thick. Harold, as his
        father often proudly observed, was a born book reviewer. From infancy it
        was observed that the outside of a book always interested him more than
        the inside, and once when his school teacher directed <a name="png.222"
        id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>him to write a
        sentence containing the word &ldquo;book,&rdquo; he wrote: &ldquo;The
        book is attractively bound and is profusely illustrated.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening, in the very busiest week of the busy season, little Harold&#8217;s
        was the only bright face at the supper table. Abner Skipp had had a bad
        day in the city; Mrs. Skipp and Angelica were exhausted from reviewing
        and household cares, and Grandpa was peevish because Abner had taken the
        &ldquo;Pea Green Fairy Book&rdquo; away from him and given him instead a
        &ldquo;Child&#8217;s History of the Congo Free State.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter, Abner?&rdquo; his wife asked him when the
        others of the family had retired. &ldquo;Does your arm hurt you again?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, wife,&rdquo; replied Abner Skipp. &ldquo;My arm does not
        trouble me; I have handled only the lightest literature for the last
        fortnight. Alas! it is the same old worry. The interest on the mortgage
        will be due again next week, and in spite of the fact that the cellar is
        so full of books that I can scarcely get into it, we have not a dollar
        above the sum required to meet our monthly bills.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        III.
      </h4>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed the hapless Abner Skipp, next morning,
        &ldquo;it seems as if nothing was being published this fall except
        popular novels, and I obtained an average of less than twenty cents on
        <a name="png.223" id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>the
        last sackload I took to town, not counting the dead ones which I sold to
        the junkman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If only there were some way of keeping them alive for a few days
        longer!&rdquo; said Mrs. Skipp. &ldquo;If one could only stimulate the
        heart action by injecting strychnine!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or even embalm them,&rdquo; said Abner, sharing his wife&#8217;s
        grewsome humor. &ldquo;But no; it is impossible to deceive a second-hand
        bookseller. He seems to know to the minute when a novel is dead, and
        declines to turn his shop into a literary morgue.&rdquo; The poor man
        sighed. &ldquo;If my employers would send me a few volumes of biography,
        or an encyclopedia, or a set of Shakespeare, we could easily meet the
        interest on the mortgage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wish, Abner, that I could be of more help to you,&rdquo; said
        Mrs. Skipp. &ldquo;If I could break myself of the habit of glancing at
        the last chapter of a novel before reviewing it, I could do ever so many
        more. Angelica is even more thoughtless than I. The poor child declares
        that some of the stories look so interesting that she forgets her work
        completely and actually begins to read them. As for Grandpa, he always
        was a great reader, and consequently has no head at all for reviewing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If Harold were a few years <span class="nw">older&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
        mused Abner. &ldquo;But there, wife, we must not spend in <a
        name="png.224" id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>vain repining
        the scant hours allotted to us for sleep. Perhaps the expressman will
        bring us some scientific books to-morrow. Quite a number were on
        Appletree&#8217;s fall list.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Abner Skipp kissed his wife affectionately, and presently the house was
        dark and still. Mrs. Skipp, worn out by the day&#8217;s work, went
        quickly to sleep; but Abner, haunted by the mortgage, passed a restless
        night. Several times he fancied he heard a noise in the cellar, as if
        the expressman were dumping another ton of books into the bin. At last,
        just before dawn, there came a loud thump, as if a volume of Herbert
        Spencer&#8217;s Autobiography had fallen to the floor. Getting out of
        bed quietly so that his weary wife should not be disturbed, Abner went
        to the cellar stairway and listened.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clicking sound was distinctly audible, and a faint light gleamed
        below.

      <p>
        Cautiously descending the stair, Abner Skipp came upon so strange a
        sight that with difficulty he restrained himself from crying out his
        astonishment. Little Harold was seated before a queer mechanism, which
        resembled a typewriter, spinning wheel, and adding machine combined,
        engaged in turning the tons of books around him into reviews, as the
        miller&#8217;s daughter spun the <a name="png.225" id="png.225"
        href="#png.225"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">213</span><span

        &ldquo;Rumpelstiltzkin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Child, what does this mean?&rdquo; cried the bewildered Abner
        Skipp. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied Harold, &ldquo;I am lifting the
        mortgage. Not long ago I saw among the advertisements in the Saturday
        Home Herald an announcement of a Magic Kit for book reviewers, with a
        capacity of 300 books per hour. Fortunately I had enough money in my
        child&#8217;s bank to pay the first installment on this wonderful outfit
        which came to-day. Is it not a marvelous invention, father? Even Grandpa
        could work it!&rdquo; Trembling with eagerness Abner Skipp bent over the
        Magic Kit, while little Harold explained the working of the various
        parts.

        To review a book all that was necessary was to press a few keys, pull a
        lever or two, and the thing was done. Reviewing by publisher&#8217;s
        slip was simplicity itself; the slips were dropped into a hopper, and
        presently emerged neatly gummed to sheets of copy paper; and if an
        extract from the book were desired, a page was quickly torn out and fed
        in with the slip. Reviewing by title page was almost as rapid. The
        operator type-wrote the title, author&#8217;s name, publisher, price,
        and number of pages, and then pulled certain levers controlling the
        necessary words and phrases, <span class="nw">such as&mdash;</span>

        and the story is told. On the other hand, look at England in Shakespeare&#8217;s
        time. The English people were inordinately happy, for there were no wars
        to depress them, barring a few little tiffs with the French and the

        Dear Sir: We absolutely cannot understand why you do not buy stock in

        not heard from you in reference to our letter. A man in your position

        should turn out a big success. It seems to us that the more rotten a
        proposition is the better the people will buy.

        Let&#8217;s get away from all this bunk stuff and think for ourselves

      </p>
      <p>
        After you invest your money in our business, do not fail to submit our
        proposition to some of your friends, so as to put this proposition over
        the top just as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        May this letter act on you and try to improve your thought on investing

        I.&mdash;THE NEAPOLITAN SIXTH.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Mr. Criticus Flub-Dubbe&#8217;s program study class began the season
        yesterday afternoon with every member present and keenly attentive.
        After a preparatory sketch of old Italian music, Mr. Dubbe told us about
        the Neapolitan Sixth, which, he said had exercised so strong an
        influence on music that, if Naples had never done anything else, this
        alone would have insured to the city fame in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Neapolitan Sixth,&rdquo; said Mr. Dubbe, &ldquo;is so called
        because the composers of the Neapolitan school of opera were the first
        to introduce it freely. D. and A. Scarlatti were at the head of the
        school and were well-known musicians. Bach, who was not so well known,
        also used this sixth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which used it first?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Givu A. Payne.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bach, of course,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dubbe. &ldquo;Bach used
        everything first.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear old Bach!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Georgiana Gush.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Neapolitan Sixth,&rdquo; continued Mr. Dubbe, &ldquo;is
        usually found in the first inversion; hence the <a name="png.250"
        id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>name, the sixth
        indicating the first inversion of the chord.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How clever!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gottem-Allbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is an altered chord, the altered tone being the super-tonic.
        The real character of the chord is submediant of the subdominant key;
        that is, it is a major chord, and the use of such a major chord in the
        solemn minor tonalities is indicative of the superficiality of the
        Italian school&mdash;a desire for a change from the strict polyphonic
        music of the times. Even the stern Bach was influenced.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Italians are so frivolous,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boru-Stiffe.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A reign of frivolity ensued,&rdquo; went on Mr. Dubbe. &ldquo;Not
        only was Italian music influenced by this sixth, but Italian art,
        architecture, sculpture, even material products. Take, for example,
        Neapolitan ice-cream. Observe the influence of the sixth. The cream is
        made in three color tones&mdash;the vanilla being the subdominant, as
        the chord is of subdominant character; the strawberry being the
        submediant, and the restful green the lowered supertonic or altered
        tone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the pineapple ice?&rdquo; asked Miss Gay Votte.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The pineapple ice is the twelfth overtone,&rdquo; replied Mr.
        Dubbe.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything that Mr. <a name="png.251"

      </p>
      <p>
        I should say there wasn&#8217;t!

        After the lecture we had a lovely hand-made luncheon. Miss Ellenborough
        presided at the doughnuts and Mrs. G. Clef poured. It was such a helpful
        hour.

        &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Dubbe, &ldquo;that Herr Weidig, in
        his lecture on the wood winds, gave a double bassoon illustration from
        Brahms&#8217; &lsquo;Chorale of St. Anthony,&rsquo; which you are to
        hear to-day. But Herr Weidig neglected to mention the most interesting
        point in the illustration&mdash;that the abysmal-toned double bassoon
        calls attention to the devil-possessed swine, St. Anthony being the
        patron saint of swine-herds. I want you to listen carefully to this
        swine motive. It is really extraordinary.&rdquo; Mr. Dubbe wrote the
        motive on the blackboard and then played it on his double bassoon,
        which, he said, is one of the very few in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The bassoon,&rdquo; said Mr. Dubbe, &ldquo;was Beethoven&#8217;s
        favorite instrument. I go further than Beethoven in preferring the
        double bassoon. Among my unpublished manuscripts are several
        compositions for this instrument, and my concerto for two double
        bassoons is now in the hands of a Berlin publisher.

        </span><span class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;But
        to recur to the Brahms chorale. You should know that it makes the second
        best variations in existence. The best are in the Heroic Symphony. The
        third best are Dvorák&#8217;s in C major.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;C. Major&mdash;that&#8217;s the man who wrote &lsquo;Dorothy
        Vernon,&rsquo;&rdquo; giggled Miss Vera Cilly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not discussing ragtime variations,&rdquo; said Mr. Dubbe,
        severely.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not knocking anybody,&rdquo; whispered Miss Gay Votte.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Another interesting point in connection with this week&#8217;s
        program,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Dubbe, &ldquo;is the river motive in Smetana&#8217;s
        symphonic poem, &lsquo;The Moldau.&rsquo; Three flutes represent
        (loosely speaking; for, as I have often told you, music cannot represent
        anything) the rippling of the Moldau, a tributary of the Danube. If the
        composer had had a larger river in mind he would have used nine flutes.
        If this composition of Smetana&#8217;s seems rather unmusical, allowance
        must be made for him, as the poor man was deaf and couldn&#8217;t hear
        how bad his own music was.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wasn&#8217;t Beethoven deaf?&rdquo; asked Miss Sara Band.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only his physical ears were affected,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dubbe.
        &ldquo;Smetana&#8217;s soul ears were also deaf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At the close of the lecture Miss Ellenborough <a name="png.253"
        id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>gave us a
        surprise in the way of raised doughnuts made in the form of a G clef.
        Mrs. Gottem-Allbeat poured.

      <h4 class="gilded">
        III.
      </h4>
      <p>
        There was an ominous flash in Dr. Dubbe&#8217;s eye when he arose to
        address the class. &ldquo;We have this week,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;a
        program barbarous enough to suit the lovers of ultra-modern music. There
        is Saint-Saëns&#8217; overture, &lsquo;Les Barbares,&rsquo; to begin
        with. This is as barbaric as a Frenchman can get, and is interesting
        chiefly as a study of how not to use the trumpets. But for sheer
        barbarity commend me to Hausegger&#8217;s &lsquo;Barbarossa.&rsquo; Here
        we find the apotheosis of modern exaggeration. Hausegger strove to make
        up for inimportant themes by a profuse use of instruments. Only one
        theme, which occurs in the third movement, is of any account, and that
        is an imitation of an old German chorale. In this most monotonously
        muted of tone-poems the composer forgot to mute one instrument&mdash;his
        pen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My! but Dr. Dubbe is knocking to-day,&rdquo; whispered Miss Sara
        Band.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The thing is in C major and opens with a C major chord,&rdquo;
        continued Dr. Dubbe. &ldquo;That is the end of the C major; it never
        returns to that key. This is modern music. Take the third movement. It
        opens with a screeching barbershop <a name="png.254" id="png.254"
        href="#png.254"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">242</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>chord. A little later ensues a prize fight
        between two themes, which continues until one of them is knocked out. In
        this edifying composition, also, snare drum sticks are used on the
        kettle drums. More modern music. Bah!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never seen Dr. Dubbe so irritated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us turn to something more cheerful,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Dubbe;
        and seating himself at the piano he played the Schubert C minor
        impromptu. &ldquo;On the second page,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where the
        key becomes A flat major, occurs a harmony which looks and sounds like a
        foreign chord. Treated harmonically it is a second dominant formation,
        and should read C flat, D natural, A flat, diminished seventh of the key
        of the dominant. Schubert does not, however, use it harmonically,
        otherwise the B natural would read C flat. These notes are enharmonic
        because, though different, they sound the same.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How clear!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gay Votte.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But Schubert, instead of progressing harmonically, goes directly
        back into the tonic of A flat major.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How careless of him!&rdquo; said Mrs. Givu A. Payne.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Schubert uses it in its natural position. If the enharmonic C
        flat were used the chord would then be in its third inversion. Each
        diminished seventh harmony may resolve in sixteen different ways.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a name="png.255" id="png.255" href="#png.255"><span class="ns">[p
        </span><span class="pgmark">243</span><span class="ns">]<br /></span></a>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;
        murmured Mrs. Fuller-Prunes. &ldquo;How much there is to know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Dubbe passed his hand across his brow as if wearied. &ldquo;I shall
        never cease to regret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Schubert did not
        write C flat. It would have been so much clearer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        After the lecture Miss Ellenborough gave us another surprise&mdash;doughnuts
        made in the shape of flats. Dr. Dubbe ate five, saying that D flat major
        was his favorite key.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rode down in the elevator with him and he repeated his remark that
        Schubert had unnecessarily bemuddled the chord.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am sure you made it very plain,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We all
        understand it now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you, indeed?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That&#8217;s more than
        I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course he was jesting. He understands everything.
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        IV.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Dubbe was in his element yesterday. The trinity of B&#8217;s&mdash;Bach,
        Beethoven, and Brahms&mdash;or, as Dr. Dubbe put it, the &ldquo;trinity
        of logicians,&rdquo; was much to his taste: a truly Gothic program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what a contrast is the second half,&rdquo; said Dr. Dubbe.
        &ldquo;In the first we have the Kings of absolute music. In his youth
        Beethoven strayed from the path (for even he must sow his musical <a
        name="png.256" id="png.256" href="#png.256"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>wild oats), but
        in his maturer years he produced no music that was not absolute. But in
        the second half we have Berlioz and program music.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought program music was music suitable for programs,&rdquo;
        said Mrs. Givu A. Payne.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Berlioz,&rdquo; continued Dr. Dubbe, &ldquo;instituted the
        &lsquo;musical reform&rsquo; in Germany&mdash;the new German school of
        Liszt and Wagner. Berlioz&#8217;s music is all on the surface, while
        Brahms&#8217; music sounds the depths. He uses the contra-bassoon in
        about all of his orchestral compositions (you will hear it to-day), and
        most of his piano works take the last A on the piano. If his bass seems
        at times muddy it is because he goes so deep that he stirs up the
        bottom.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How clear!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gay Votte.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take measure sixty-five in Berlioz&#8217;s &lsquo;Dance of the
        Sylphs,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dr. Dubbe. &ldquo;The spirits hover over
        Faust, who has fallen asleep. The &#8217;cellos are sawing away drowsily
        on their pedal point D (probably in sympathy with Faust), and what
        sounds like Herr Thomas tuning the orchestra is the lone A of the fifth.
        The absent third represents the sleep of Faust. This is a trick common
        to the new school. Wagner uses it in &lsquo;Siegfried,&rsquo; in the
        close of the Tarnhelm motive, to illustrate the vanishing properties of
        the cap. In measure fifty-seven of the Ballet you will find a chord of
        the augmented five-six, a harmony <a name="png.257" id="png.257"
        href="#png.257"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">245</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>built on the first inversion of the diminished
        seventh of the key of the dominant, with lowered bass tone, and which in
        this instance resolves into the dominant triad. Others claim that this
        harmony is a dominant ninth with root omitted and lowered fifth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has always seemed so to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fuller-Prunes.
        But I don&#8217;t believe she knows a thing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it&#8217;s all awfully cute,&rdquo; said Miss Georgiana
        Gush.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The harmony,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Dubbe, frowning, &ldquo;really
        sounds like a dominant seventh, and may be changed enharmonically into a
        dominant seventh and resolve into the Neapolitan sixth. This is all
        clear to you, I suppose?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; we all replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Dubbe then analyzed and played for us Brahms&#8217; First Symphony,
        after which Miss Ellenborough served doughnuts made in the shape of a
        Gothic B. We all had to eat them&mdash;one for Bach, one for Beethoven,
        and one for Brahms.
      </p>
      <h4 class="gilded">
        V.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Dubbe did not appear enthusiastic over this week&#8217;s program. I
        guess because there was no Bach or Brahms on it. But we enjoyed his
        lecture just the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Raff was the Raphael of music,&rdquo; said Dr. <a name="png.258"
        id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>Dubbe. &ldquo;He
        was handicapped by a superabundance of ideas, but, unlike Raphael, he
        did not constantly repeat himself. This week we will have a look at his
        Fifth Symphony, entitled &lsquo;Lenore.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Georgiana Gush, &ldquo;that&#8217;s the
        one the hero of &lsquo;The First Violin&rsquo; was always whistling.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As you all know,&rdquo; said Dr. Dubbe, &ldquo;this symphony is
        based on Bürger&#8217;s well-known ballad of &lsquo;Lenore,&rsquo; but
        as only the last movement is concerned with the actual ballad I will
        confine my remarks mainly to that. I wish, however, to call your
        attention to a curious harmony in the first movement. Upon the return of
        the first theme the trombones break in upon a dominant B major harmony
        with what is apparently a dominant C major harmony, D, F, and B. But the
        chords are actually enharmonic of D, E sharp, and B. This is a dominant
        harmony in F sharp. Listen for these trombone chords, and pay special
        attention to the E sharp&mdash;a tone that is extremely characteristic
        of Raff.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I have read somewhere,&rdquo; said Mrs. Givu A. Payne,
        &ldquo;that Raff was exceedingly fond of E sharp.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; said Dr. Dubbe. &ldquo;He often said he didn&#8217;t
        see how he could get along without it. But to resume:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The fourth movement opens with Lenore&#8217;s <a name="png.259"
        id="png.259" href="#png.259"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>lamentation
        over her absent lover and her quarrel with her mother&mdash;the oboe
        being the girl and the bassoon her parent. Lenore foolishly curses her
        fate (tympani and triangle), and from that moment is lost. There is a
        knock at the door and her dead lover appears with a horse and suggests
        something in the nature of an elopement. Not knowing he is dead, Lenore
        acquiesces, and away they go (trumpets, flutes and clarinets).
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&#8217;T&nbsp;is a wild and fearful night. Rack scuds across the
        moon&#8217;s wan face (violas and second violins). Hanged men rattle in
        their chains upon the wayside gibbets (triangle and piccolo). But on,
        on, on go the lovers, one dead and the other nearly so.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At last they reach the grave in the church-yard, and death claims
        the lost Lenore (&#8217;cellos and bass viols <i>pizzicato</i>). For a
        conclusion there is a coda founded on the line in the ballad, &lsquo;Gott
        sei der Seele gnädig.&rsquo; It is very sad.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Dubbe seemed much affected by the sad tale, and many of us had to
        wipe tears away. But Miss Ellenborough came to our rescue with some
        lovely doughnuts made in the shape of a true lovers&#8217; knot. These,
        with the tea, quite restored us.

      <p>
        There really wasn&#8217;t any study class this week&mdash;that is, Dr.
        Dubbe did not appear. While the <a name="png.260" id="png.260"

      <p>
        &ldquo;The eccentricity of genius, my dear,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
        Gottem-Allbeat. &ldquo;Genius is not tied down by rules of conduct of
        any sort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Givu A. Payne, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t blame
        him for not wanting to analyze this week&#8217;s program. There isn&#8217;t
        a bit of Bach or Brahms on it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said Miss Ellenborough, coming forward with a
        gentleman who had just arrived, &ldquo;let me introduce Mr. Booth
        Tarkington, of Indiana. Mr. Tarkington came up to attend the lecture,
        but as Dr. Dubbe will not be here Mr. Tarkington has kindly consented to
        give a doughnut recital, so to speak.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, how lovely!&rdquo; we all exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mr. Tarkington,&rdquo; added Miss Ellenborough, &ldquo;is well
        known as the author of the Beaucaire doughnut, the pride of Indiana

        which Miss Ellenborough removed the screen that conceals her work table
        and Mr. Tarkington, in an incredibly short time, produced a batch of
        Beaucaires. They were really excellent, and we didn&#8217;t leave a
        single one. Mr. Everham Chumpleigh Keats poured.
      </p>
      <p>
        After tea we all adjourned to the concert, which we enjoyed immensely,
        in spite of the absence of Bach and Brahms. Not knocking Dr. Dubbe.

        by the fire a long while since, glow-worms and briar rose; for of all
        these things and more is poetry made. It is to be cut off forever from
        the fellowship of great men that are gone; to see men and women without
        their halos and the world without its glory; to miss the meaning lurking
        behind the common things, like elves hiding in flowers; it is to beat
        one&#8217;s hands all day against the gates of Fairyland and to find

        Dear Subscriber: You probably know that the Local editor and his wife
        have been away from Winneconne most of the time during the last ten
        months. Every month we expected to get back again. The suspense was
        somewhat hard. During the meantime Mrs. Flanagan, each week, <a
        name="png.274" id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>would worry and
        talk about the paper as much as ever. The doctor desired to have it off
        her mind. During the meantime she did not want the plant closed for even
        a short time. Now it has been decided to take a holiday vacation, during
        which time Mr. and Mrs. Flanagan will release themselves from all
        business cares and build up in health. No doubt, you will realize the
        delicate situation of the affair, and bear with us in the matter until
        the Local again resumes its regular publication dates, for surely both
        of us are very much attached to the paper, the town, and its people, and
        the surrounding country. <span class="sigrt smc">M.&nbsp;C. Flanagan.</span>

        Democracy has the greatest inducement to elect representatives who are
        representative, who, in the first place, resemble it as closely as
        possible, who, in the second place, have no individuality of their own,
        who, finally, having no fortune of their own, have no sort of
        independence. We deplore <a name="png.278" id="png.278" href="#png.278"><span
        class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">266</span><span class="ns">]
        /></span></a>that democracy surrenders itself to politicians, but from
        its own point of view, a point of view which it cannot avoid taking up,
        it is absolutely right. What is a politician? He is a man who, in
        respect of his personal opinions, is a nullity, in respect of education
        a mediocrity; he shares the general sentiments and passions of the
        crowds, his sole occupation is politics, and if that career were closed
        to him he would die of starvation. He is precisely the thing of which
        democracy has need. He will never be led away by his education to
        develop ideas of his own; and, having no ideas of his own, he will not
        allow them to enter into conflict with his prejudices. His prejudices
        will be, at first, by a feeble sort of conviction, afterward, by reason
        of his own interest, identical with those of the crowd; and lastly, his
        poverty and the impossibility of his getting a living outside of
        politics make it certain that he will never break out of the narrow
        circle where his political employers have confined him; his imperative
        mandate is the material necessity which obliges him to obey; his
        imperative mandate is his inability to quarrel with his bread and
        butter. Democracy obviously has need of politicians, has need of nothing
        else but politicians, and has need indeed that there shall be in
        politics nothing else but politicians.

        opinion; free to read the newspapers with no thought of commenting on
        the contents; free to glance at a few hectic headlines, and then bite
        into a book that you have meant to get to for a long time past, to read
        it slowly, without skipping, to read over an especially well done page
        and to put the book aside and meditate on the moral which it pointed, or
        left you to point. Unless obliged to, why should anybody write when he
        can read instead? One&#8217;s own opinions (hastily formed and lacking
        even the graces of expression) are of small account; certainly they are
        of less account than Mr. Mill&#8217;s observations on Liberty, which I
        have put down in order to pen a few longish paragraphs. (I would rather
        be reading, you understand; my pen is running for the same reason some
        street cars run&mdash;to hold the franchise.) And speaking of Mill, do
        you remember the library catalogue which contained the consecutive

        One can get through a good many books on a long railway journey. My
        slender stock was exhausted before I reached Colorado, and I am
        compelled to re-read until such time as I can lay <a name="png.286"
        id="png.286" href="#png.286"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">274</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>in a fresh
        supply. At home it is difficult to find time to read&mdash;that is,
        considerable stretches of time, so that one may really digest the pages
        which he is leisurely taking in. Fifty years ago there were not many
        more books worth reading than there are to-day, but there was more time
        to assimilate them. A comparatively few books thoroughly assimilated
        gave us Lincoln&#8217;s Gettysburg address. Not long ago my friend the
        Librarian was speaking of this short classic. &ldquo;Did you ever,&rdquo;
        said he, &ldquo;read Edward Everett&#8217;s address at Gettysburg?&rdquo;
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I fear I shall never get to it.&rdquo;
        &ldquo;It is stowed away among his collected orations,&rdquo; said he.
        &ldquo;Not half bad. Unfortunately for its fame, Mr. Lincoln happened
        along with a few well chosen remarks which the world has preferred to
        remember.&rdquo;

        Another advantage of a long railway journey is the opportunity it
        affords to give one&#8217;s vocal cords a (usually) well-merited rest.
        It is possible to travel across the continent without saying a word. A
        nod or a shake of the head suffices in your dealings with the porter;
        and you learn nothing from questioning him, as he has not been on that
        run before. Also, business with the train and Pullman conductors may be
        transacted in silence, and there is no profit in asking the latter to
        exchange your upper berth for a lower, as he has <a name="png.287"
        id="png.287" href="#png.287"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">275</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>already been
        entreated by all the other occupants of uppers. When the train halts you
        do not have to ask, &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo;&mdash;you may find
        out by looking at the large sign on the station. Nor is it necessary to
        inquire, &ldquo;Are we on time?&rdquo;&mdash;your watch and time-table
        will enlighten you. You do not have to exclaim, when a fresh locomotive
        is violently attached, &ldquo;Well, I see we got an engine&rdquo;&mdash;there
        is always somebody to say it for you. And you write your orders in the
        dining car. There is, of course, the chance of being accosted in the
        club car, but since this went dry the danger has been slight. And
        conversation can always be averted by absorption in a book, or, in a
        crisis, by pretending to be dumb.

      <hr class="mini" />
      <p>
        Not everybody can travel three or four days without exchanging words
        with a fellow traveler. Mr. George Moore, for example, would be quite
        wretched. Conversation is the breath of his being, he says somewhere. I
        understand that Mr. Moore has another book on press, entitled &ldquo;Avowals.&rdquo;
        Avowals! My dear!&hellip; After the &ldquo;Confessions&rdquo; and the
        &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; what in the world is there left for the man to
        avow?

      <hr class="mini" />
      <p>
        What a delightful fictionist is Moore! And never more delightful than
        when he is writing fiction under the appearance of fact. No one has <a
        name="png.288" id="png.288" href="#png.288"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">276</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>taken more to
        heart the axiom that the imaginary is the only real. As my friend the
        Librarian observed, the difference between George Moore and Baron
        Munchausen is that Moore&#8217;s lies are interesting.

      <hr class="mini" />
      <p>
        Travelers must carry their own reading matter under government
        ownership. The club car library now consists of time-tables, maps, and
        pamphlets setting forth the never to be forgotten attractions of the
        show places along the way. These are all written by the celebrated prose
        poet Ibid, and, with a bottle of pseudo beer or lemon pop, help to make
        the club car as gay a place as a mortician&#8217;s parlor on a rainy
        afternoon.

        The treeless plateau over which the train rolls, hour after hour, is the
        result of a great uplift. It was not sudden; it was slow but sure. This
        result is arid and plateautudinous, in a manner of speaking&mdash;not
        the best manner. It makes me think of democracy&mdash;and prohibition.
        To this complexion we shall come at last. To be sure, the genius of man
        will continue to cut channels in the monotonous plain; erosion will
        relieve the dreary prospect with form and color, but it bids fair to be,
        for the most part, a flat and dry world, from which many of us will part
        with a minimum of regret. There will remain the inextinguishable <a

        At Albuquerque I remarked a line of Mexicans basking in the sun (having,
        perhaps, finished jumping on their mothers). They looked happy&mdash;as
        happy as the Russian peasants used to be. Men who know Russia tell me
        that the peasants really were happy, even under the twin despotisms of
        Vodka and Czar. It was not, of course, a reformer&#8217;s idea of
        happiness: a reformer&#8217;s idea of happiness is perpetual attention
        to everybody&#8217;s business but his own. People who are interested
        academically in other people&#8217;s happiness usually succeed in making
        everybody unhappy. Now, the Russian&#8217;s happiness was a poor thing,
        but his own. In reality he was wretched and oppressed, and his voice and
        bearing should have expressed his misery and hopelessness, instead of a
        foolish content and a silly detachment from political affairs. But he is
        at last emancipated, and, as was said of Mary&#8217;s fleecy companion,
        now contemplate the condemned thing!

        There are so many interesting things along the way that I should, I

        taking notes? as the good Sylvestre Bonnard inquired. Lovers who truly
        love do not keep a diary of their happiness.

        In Phoenix, Arizona, distance lends enchantment to the view. But the
        hills are far away, and as I did not visit the Southwest to contemplate
        the works of man, however ingenious, I followed the westering sun to
        where the mountains come down to the sea. I do not fancy the elevated
        parts of New Mexico and Arizona; and as there was no thought of pleasing
        me when they were created, I feel free to express a modified rapture in
        their contemplation. I should have remembered enough geology to know
        that granite is not found in this section, except at the bottom of the
        Grand Canyon. The hills I like are made of old-fashioned stuff, not
        young upstart tufa and sandstone that was not thought of when the
        Laurentians were built. One really cannot have much respect for a rock
        that he can kick to pieces. The gay young buttes in this land of quickly
        shifting horizons are not without their charm; they look well <a
        name="png.291" id="png.291" href="#png.291"><span class="ns">[p </span><span
        class="pgmark">279</span><span class="ns">] /></span></a>in certain
        lights, and they are decidedly better than no hills at all. Although
        immature, they have an air of pretending to be very ancient, to be the
        ruins of mountains. They are picturesque and colorful. And I would swap
        a league of them for one archaic boulder the size of a box-car, with a
        thick coverlet of reindeer moss.

        When I left the train at Pasadena I saw what I took to be a procession
        of the K.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;K. It proved to be citizens in flu masks. I was
        interested, but not alarmed; whereas a lady tourist who debarked on the
        following day fell in a swoon and was conveyed to the hospital. The
        newspapers charged her disorder to the masks, but as she was from
        Chicago I suspect that her reason was unsettled by the sudden revealment
        of a clean city. And Pasadena is clean&mdash;almost immaculate. I was
        obliged to join the masqueraders, and I found the inconvenience only
        slight. The mask keeps the nose warm after sundown, and is convenient to
        sneeze into. And I have never remarked better looking folks than the
        people of Pasadena. The so-called human race has never appeared to
        better advantage. The women were especially charming, and were all, for
        once, equally handicapped, like the veiled sex in the Orient.

        I shall say nothing about the never to be sufficiently esteemed climate
        of California, nor even allude to the windjammers of Loz Onglaze. The
        last word concerning those enthusiasts was spoken by a San Francisco man
        who, addressing the people of &ldquo;Los,&rdquo; explained how the city
        might overcome the slight handicap imposed by its distance from the sea.
        &ldquo;Lay an iron pipe to tidewater,&rdquo; he advised; &ldquo;and
        then, if you can suck as hard as you can blow, you will presently have
        the ocean at your doors.&rdquo; It would be difficult to improve on that
        criticism. And so, instead of praising the climate, I will gladly
        testify that it is easier to live in this part of the country than
        anywhere east of the Sierras. And San Diego impresses me as the easiest

        fish market in the village. But each day I see the sign in the window,
        &ldquo;No fish.&rdquo; The fisherman, I am told, is &ldquo;very
        independent,&rdquo; a euphemism for tired, perhaps. He casts his hooks
        and nets only when the spirit moves him, and is not impelled to the sea
        by sordid motives. A true fisherman, I thought, though he never change
        his window sign.

        To-day&#8217;s newspapers contain the protest of the governor of Lower
        California against the proposed annexing of his territory by the United
        States, Señor Cantu may be a hairless dog in the manger; he may, as he
        claims, represent the seething patriotism of all but a negligible
        percentage of the population; but he is no doubt correct in merely
        asserting that the peninsula will not be annexed. Incidentally, he is on
        sure ground when he attributes the chaos in Mexican affairs to &ldquo;conflicting
        political criteria.&rdquo; It is all of that. So far as I have casually
        discovered, there is no active annexation sentiment on this side of the
        border, for there is no hope of overcoming that provision in the Mexican
        constitution which makes it a <a name="png.294" id="png.294"

        for the diminution of Mexican territory.

      <p>
        Gov. Cantu&#8217;s phrase, &ldquo;conflicting political criteria,&rdquo;
        applies rather happily to the doings in Paris these days. The Peace
        conference and prohibition in the United States are perhaps the two most
        prominent topics before the public, and they are the two things which I
        have not heard mentioned since I began my travels.

        class="smc">You</span> cannot &ldquo;make Chicago literary&rdquo; by
        moving the magazine market to that city. Authors lay the scenes of their
        stories in New York rather than in Chicago, because readers prefer to
        have the scene New York, just as English readers prefer London to
        Manchester or Liverpool. If a story is unusually interesting it is of no
        consequence where the scene is laid, but most stories are only so-so and
        have to borrow interest from geography.

        seven and twentieth year of my captivity, I have been much distressed by
        the monotony of my existence. My habitation is as complete as I can
        wish; I have all the clothing to my need; and my subjects&mdash;my man
        Friday and his father, and the Spaniard&mdash;keep me abundantly
        supplied with food. When I was alone the necessity of husbandry gave me
        plenty to do, but now I am oppressed by a great lack of matter for
        occupation, both physical and mental. Questioning myself, I put the
        blame upon an evil state of mind into which I have fallen, in no longer
        finding profit in reading my bible and other books, or in meditating on
        this life and that which is to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am rich in that I want for no material thing; and I am idle, in that I
        do naught to profit myself or my companions; so that, although
        practically a solitary, I am, as you might say, an idle rich class, and
        were I multiplied by thousands I should be a grievous burden on society.

        meals, and he has contrived so to expand them, both in quantity of food
        and time spent in consuming it, that a large part of my day is now given
        over to eating. I drink a great deal of wine with my meals, and of rum
        also, a great store of which I saved from the wreck; and these strong
        waters, added to the great quantity of food consumed, produce in me a
        pleasant torpor, which I find to be a satisfactory substitute for

        II.
      </h4>
      <p>
        My man Friday came running to me this afternoon to relate that &ldquo;many
        great number&rdquo; of savages were landed on our shore, and that, by
        the preparations the wretches were making, a great feast was intended.
        The news was extremely welcome, for I have become so bored by the
        monotony of existence that any pretext for going abroad after nightfall
        is a godsend. So after disposing of a heavy dinner, that included six
        kinds of wines and liquors, my carriage, as I called it (though it was
        no more than a litter), was fetched by Friday and his father; and
        followed by the Spaniard, carrying my cloak and perspective glass, I set
        out for a little wooded hill that overlooked the beach on which the
        savages were encamped.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dreadful wretches had finished their <a name="png.319" id="png.319"
        href="#png.319"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">307</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>inhuman feast and were squatting on the sand,
        watching one of their number, a comely female, who was dancing wildly in
        a circle of strong firelight. The body of this creature was swathed in
        veils, which she removed, one after the other, until she was wholly
        naked. This degrading spectacle seemed to be enormously enjoyed by the
        spectators, who were grouped in the form of a horseshoe. I observed,
        also, that they were decorated with feathers and glass beads, and that,
        except for these ornaments, were as naked as the dancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Spaniard, a God fearing man, was greatly shocked by the sight, and my
        man Friday, too, was strongly affected; but to my shame I must confess
        that I did not share their abhorrence. Yet even my stomach began to
        protest when the dancer, darting to one of the canoes, appeared with a
        gory head that had been chopped from one of the victims of the feast,
        and continued her shocking gyrations, to a most infernal din of
        barbarous musical instruments that half a hundred of the wretches were
        beating. The Spaniard and Friday urged, in their indignation, that we
        discharge our muskets at the unholy crew; but I restrained them from
        such an intelligible piece of violence, reflecting that the barbarous
        customs of these people might be regarded as their own disaster, and
        that I was not called upon to judge <a name="png.320" id="png.320"
        href="#png.320"><span class="ns">[p </span><span class="pgmark">308</span><span
        class="ns">] /></span></a>their actions, much less to execute the
        judgment of heaven upon them. Besides, they were in such numbers that,
        had we attacked, we should have been overwhelmed. So, calling for my
        litter, I returned to my habitation.

        in the writer. There are exceptions, of course; for example, Henry Adams
        and Jacques Casanova.

      <p>
        An unusual function for men in business circles was that which John
        Voelkel, janitor of the First National bank, supervised, Saturday
        evening. He gave a dinner, card party and a smoker to all the officers
        of the bank. Invitations were issued to every member of the staff, from
        president to clerk, and those who assembled at the custodian&#8217;s
        home made merry for several hours at an event probably without a
        duplicate in banking history in Iowa City.

        Transcriber&#8217;s Note
      </h3>
      <p>
        Minor punctuation errors have been repaired, but inconsistent spelling
        and hyphenation have been left as printed in light of the author&#8217;s
        extensive use of dialect and deliberate humorous mis-spelling.
